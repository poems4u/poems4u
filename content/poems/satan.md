When, when he snubbed his nose at me <br>  
Oh, how I bristled with delight. <br>  
Nothing but evil could he be <br>  
who took such pleasure in my plight. <br>  

It was already known, the thought <br>  
which bore its way into his mind. <br>  
Serreptitious there, demon bought <br>  
Solely for pleasure of its kind. <br>  

But when the dog steals all the food <br>  
Or when a child, denied, does cry, <br>  
'Twas by a Spinozistic mode <br>  
Those barbaric desires fly <br>  

Into the poor and ill-restrained <br>  
mechanical animal mind. <br>  
How could impulsed thoughts be detained <br>  
in faculties considered blind? <br>  

With me it's much in the same way. <br>  
My simple heart, incapable <br>  
Of begrudging malice in day <br>  
In moonlight turns implacable. <br>  

And as such light shines through the grove, <br>  
And the pinewood smells of winter. <br>  
The trees dropped leaves- It wasn't chose <br>  
more than such frost in December, <br>  

But mine enemy loves his sole free will <br>  
One God amongst all men, henceforth to kill. <br>
