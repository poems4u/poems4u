Whereof your thoughts when discovering you ran, <br>  
In begging to end in circles again? <br>  

Whenceforth you came indeed there you shall go; <br>  
Wherefrom the soul us made we cannot know. <br>  

And what would become of the Holy Saw? <br>  
That is, what was once seen, now not at all, <br>  
or the Holy Aurai Voir.
