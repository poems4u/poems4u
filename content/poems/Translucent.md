I miss that little boy <br>  
There were days when he cried and screamed <br>  
But there are days when I do that too <br>  

And I think he liked me - <br>  
They were all calling for me to come back <br>  

I was looking at pictures today <br>  
They exist like beacons in a haze <br>  
But the fog is too thick- <br>  
Nothing is illuminated <br>  

When was this? <br>  
Who am I? <br>  

Your smile is so bright there <br>  
and I'll never see it again <br>  
nor remember how it was conjured <br>  
in the first place <br>  

To you, I must be a corpse <br>  
with a death mask- <br>  
And some wretched animating force <br>  
moving me- <br>  

And you were fooled to think this dead alive <br>  
But perhaps by this power it <br>  
was- and so it will <br>  

 I dug it all up today- <br>  
and I'm sorry <br>  
it was a demon in me, <br>  
or something <br>  

But even he could grow weary, <br>  
and I often tucked him in with a glass of warm milk <br>  
so we could be left alone. <br>  

page 1 was proof <br>  
and so are the photos <br>  
But who took them? <br>  

Primitive notion of a <br>  
demon/mind union <br>  
Calvin- where is he now? <br>  

I'm not sure <br>  

cop say she crazy now <br>  
Please don't let it be her <br>  

The spell was strong indeed, <br>  
my prayers today were the haziest yet. <br>  

And I couldn't focus <br>  
And I wasn't there <br>  
And I wasn't him <br>  
And I didn't hear <br>  
And it's all fading <br>   
And the sat will stand <br>  
And you'll take your place <br>  
And I'll squint my eyes <br>  
And I'll turn my turn- my neck <br>  
And all I will forget <br>  
Because I won't be able to find <br>  
Who it was that paid my rent <br>  
(What was your name, again?) <br>  

 And I still remember Kiev.
