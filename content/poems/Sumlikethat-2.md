i got a friend with a house in seneca <br>  
it's got a beautiful sun room, <br>  
really a porch with windows that looks out on the real porch <br>  
and the property got a big ol yard she told me they dont never use <br>  
and one day when she was a child, sittin in the sun room <br>  
as the afternoon rays gave the trees those angles <br>  
she seen a demon run cross the yard <br>  


or sum like that  

i seen plenty demons too <br>  
in the woods <br>  
in my head <br>  
at the funnel cake stand <br>  
 white millennial lady with glasses and a affect said to us <br>  
"would yall wanna come back to my place? how old are yall?" <br>  
"we 16" <br>   
 a brief pause  <br>  
 maybe the earth stop spinnin  <br>  
or i had a stroke <br>  

or sum like that  

"would yall wanna come back to my place?" <br>  
"how old are yall?"  <br>  

 they run a prostitution ring out back by where i work  <br>  
out the restroom of the parkin deck  <br>  
 one time my coworker and my boss was out there, <br>  
 after work, havin em a joint or sum  <br>  
and one of the hoes, a cracked out lil white bitch, poor thing, gon come up pon my coworker pacing back and forth: <br>  
(now my coworker a 62 year old transwoman  
with bout the worst pothead brain you can imagine  
but sweet as can be)  <br>  
"you look like sum"  <br>  
and then she gon turn to my boss and say:  <br>  
 (now my boss is a college student, built, but with a face youd wanna kiss)  <br>  
"you look like sum too"  <br>  
and her cracked ass keep walkin back and forth, starin, till she go get the pimp  <br>  
and the pimp come walkin out showin his knife  <br>  
 and they thought it was gonna be a fight so my coworker she grab the chain out her bike <br>    
but the pimp slap the hoe and say:  <br>  
"stop botherin people"  <br>  
 and he come up on my boss and they exchange a few words  <br>  
 and he end up sayin:  <br>  
"yall workin people, i respect that"  <br>  

or sum like that  

and my boss done shook his hand  

and when they had me locked up <br>  
it was this girl in there with me <br>  
sweet thing, they called her little bit  <br>  
and she was cute too  <br>  
she wanted me but, you know, i dont- i dont know  <br>  
but she had this girlfriend that was crazier than errybody in there  <br>  
 and little bit lived with her cuz her momma was crazy or <br>  

sum like that  

but the girlfriend wouldnt give her none of her stuff back after they broke up  <br>  
and she held her cats hostage  <br>  
the girlfriend even hit her once- on her birthday  <br>  
lesbians can be mean too is what i learned, i guess  <br>  

that girlfriend, she had sum like that <br>  
i reckon my father had sum like that too  <br>  

and now i hear that they be say that im in the bushes  <br>  
or on a stakeout  <br>  
schemin n plottin my every move  <br>  
just so that it might seem as if 2 ships were passin  <br>  
when in reality i had actually designed it to simply appear that way  

or sum like that  

they lookin for to lock me up  <br>  
for an idea  <br>  
a fear that dont exist  <br>  
because really they overestimate me <br>    
i dont have neither the wherewithal nor the skills  <br>  
besides, i dont even know where i am right now  <br>  

but, you know, if you did happen to see john 3:16 <center>scrawled on the wall in o negative  <br>  
it mightve been me <br>
