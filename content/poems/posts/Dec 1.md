Like the creek happens to run with automobile traffic <br>  
(Though they are at best enemies) <br>  
so too, if you find yourself amongst the 7 foilaged trees <br>  
in the heart of winter, <br>  
likely without your rosary, <br>   
The Beam comes around the bend <br>  
And the tic turns your head <br>  
To meet its gaze feeling as steam <br>  
Screaming, you'll kneel. <br>  
 
eventually, prostrate, <br>  
Ants will crawl up your nose <br>  
And the orchestra will appear <br>  
held there, supplicant <br>  
They'll play <br>  
and you will cry, <br>  

And as the intermission starts, <br>  
while the conductor and the concert master <br>  
shake hands, smiling towards <br>  
a thunderous applause <br>  
with no eyes, <br>  
a car will fly off of <br>  
Fordham Blvd. <br>  

Many in the ensemble will be flattened <br>  
And you will sink through the floor <br>  
left with only sonerous memories, <br>  
To be met at the desk of Hell <br>  

You'll get checked in <br>  
(Wow! Ninth Circle!) <br>  

once you're up to your neck <br>  
and a few weeks pass, <br>  
a hole will open in the ceiling <br>  

It's Jesus <br>  
accompanied with the ringing of hundreds of millions <br>  
of telephones, <br>  
and his eyes will tell you <br>  
he'll be back soon <br>  

He'll drop you down a pair of skates <br>  
Beelzebub and Yaldaboath <br>  
will jump for them <br>  
but be blasted back. <br>  

Your naked body will be freed <br>  
and you'll skate-in-wait <br>  
as the icy wind blows, <br>  
and your teeth will chatter <br>  
 with a smile <br>
