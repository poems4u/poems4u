When the suns arise they seem to no <br>  
The rays raising race <br>  
To be low for to bestow <br>  
'Da face towards the <br>  
Enemy. <br>  
The shame burn <br>  
Including words; four <br>  
Psychotics. <br>  
Sike-ology. <br>  
Witch spells of cow words. <br>  
Mooooooooooon. <br>  
Liking this <br>  
Guy <br>  
Welcomes the star <br>  
T-w/o-words <br>  
Two seas. <br>  
The days requires <br>  
Re$pirations. <br>  
Two of them <br>  
Who long awaited <br>  
Blanket. <br>  
Cross it <br>  
Out. <br>  
For in cruise <br>  
Won is happiness; <br>  
Is hairy a bad thing to be? <br>

An essence contrived not from a TV, <br>  
But of an image made known from his love. <br>  
The Person of Christ, A.D., sets us free.}
