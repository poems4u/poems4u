Slow it up speed it up! <br>  
Like the derivative of a circle, <br>  
Like a sin wave,

Like the sublime and gorgeous <br>  
Hills of the North Carolina piedmont. 

I want to feel that incline. <br>  
I want to roll my body down, <br>  

But this is not enough.

I can't go back up once I'm in the valley; <br>  
Physics don't work that way. <br>  
And I'm left on my back <br>  
With eyes towards the sky. 

No, <br>  
I want to be integrated.
I wanna be dropped on Pilot Mountain + make a whole like Wile E. Coyote. <br>  
I wanna be put on Lin Biao's airliner and slam into the fake Empire State Building in Winston. <br>  

I want my body dismembered, pulverized, and slowly released from a helicopter onto the rolling fields before me, <br>  
And I want to water the pasture with my guts. 

But keep my decapitated head, <br>  
And take it to the top of Mt. Pisgah. <br>  
Have someone pitch it and hit a home run. <br>  
No, <br>  
Punt it, <br>  
Punt it as hard as you can, <br>  
So hard your leg falls off.

If I'm lucky, I'll fly all the way to downtown Ashville <br>  
And through the roof of Chai Pani into someone's fucking tandoor wrap.

I'd still be content, though, <br>  
To fall down the side of the mountain, <br>  
My severed head bruised, bumped, scratched, sexed by His architecture, <br>  
To land in the creek. 

And I'll float like a buoy, <br>  
Eyes fixed towards [REDACTED] like Mecca, <br>  
Until I reach the ocean, and that fish eats my eye <br>  
As I did unto him. 

Y'know what? <br>  
Let that fucking cardinal have my other eye, <br>  
Then I'll have two eye patches like a retarded pirate. <br>  
I'll sail to the middle of I-40 West, <br>  
Groping for the X that marks that spot. <br>  

And when _that_ yellow hummer hits my body going 85 and launches me into _that_ hospital bed to be later released upon the socius half baked, i can say <br>  
"A mode of God!" <br>  
Like a good Spinozan. 

If they're right that consciousness is like a clenched anus, <br>  
Then mine is so tight that if you fucked my pussy it would explode like a fecal-nuke, <br>  
And Milan Hair Removal, the university, [REDACTED], would all be reduced to a bubbling pile of molten shit. 

Fucking Condorcet is here too; <br>  
He's measuring my dick to redistribute it to the masses; <br>  
These fucking maggot brains only think something is valuable if it's in use. 

I'm at the other Stone Mountain <br>  
[REDACTED] <br>  
Stonewall: Who threw the first brick? <br>  
Stonewall: Who shot him off his horse? 

My Roaring Gap sends out an Earth-shattering yawp that says <br>  
To Alan, <br>  
Who once told me to never write about death, <br>  
"Fuck you, cunt."
