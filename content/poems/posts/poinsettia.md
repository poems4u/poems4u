She lived, like Anna, in a chapel <br>  
Until Father, <br>  
Behest of Pastor, <br>  
Sent her away, <br>  
Because Christmas was over.

She came home with us, <br>  
And I was envious of her soft yet textured <br>  
Red dress <br>  
And green trimming. 

I don't think she liked the window. <br>  

Though she would always smile back at me, <br>  
She once asked where all tthe reds and blues <br>  
And yellows and greens had gone. 

I liked to watch her, <br>  
Plumage at altar, <br>  
Swept in the careening dance of light, <br>  
Standing up tall and full.

By mid-January, she developed a cough <br>  
And asked if God would come to visit, <br>  
As they had once been roommates <br>  
And loved each other dearly. 

I told her she ought to know better—— <br>  
And she agreed. 

It's warming now, <br>  
early, <br>  
And bored, <br>  
Lonely, <br>  
She slouches towards despair. 

Undressing, <br>  
She leaves her gown on the floor, <br>  
More shit to stick to my feet.
