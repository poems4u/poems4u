"I loved my friend. <br>  
He went away from me."

---

In the aftermath of the embrace—— <br>  
In the broadening of the seperation between the one going <br>  
Coming Down <br>  
And the One remaining in that place away from places—— <br>  

The increasing distance between two hearts <br>  
Is not negative, <br>  

Empty, 

But rather is filled with that expansion of love <br>  
Which pours out from the cracks in amphorous memory-vessels. 

As words, ideas dissolve into dimly lit exhales under Red Oaks; <br>  
Cyan leaves, lime waters, the invisible presence; <br>  
A 6-person home whose defined borders collapse into browns and lengths, <br>  
Into candles, jazz, and feelings, <br>  
Yes, feelings——of something or other. 

But how could one forget the doing of dishes, the hands and feet, the service, <br>  
The conviction, <br>  
The hope and the affliction, <br>  
The strecthing limbs as <br>  
Gifts offered in mutual recognition? 

And when our plane of faith no longer covers half a geography <br>  
But becomes contented to fill a room, <br>  

Perhaps that writer will again come to us; <br>  
While he picks at his scalp and cuticles <br>  
We can convince him of whatever we want! <br>  
A silly dream of vision, <br>  
Identity, <br>  
Passing away—— <br>  
We won't dream, <br>  
and we won't dream of remaining. 

When he finally lets our dyad alone, <br>  
All three of us will be gathered there; <br>  
Our souls will be as close as they once were 

Before All Ages.

Command:  <br>  
"C.W.M., I command you to go to sleep and dream."

Response:  <br>  
"Aw, dream, ohh, what am I 'gon dream about? <br>  
I done dreamt all I can dream in life; <br>  
I'm tryna wake up and live and make some money offa dreams that <br>  
That people been making money off of my dreams. <br>  
You know, everything I dreamt about...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christmas trees——no good <br>  
You know I ain't gon go for nun like that, <br>  
I chop you down, then what's gon be happenin'...?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are the ones tryna wake up——you don't want me to go sleep; <br>  
I chop you down and you'll be dead... <br>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gotta tree at home that's mean <br>  
That was planted back in 1930 sum, <br>  
You know the big Ol' Oak Tree, Wes? <br>  
You scared of him, chiggers 'n shit 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How's Hitler a tree: 
I went to—I went by some forest the other day—— <br>  
A woman was makin' love to tree <br>  
But she, you know, she didn't get no satisfaction...a tree don't last long...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I chop you down. I chop you down."
