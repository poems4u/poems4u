Awoken from slumber and feeling the tension of the moment _par coup_, <br>  
I fly to the archives, meticulously kept but thus far unread. <br>   

These records changed me; <br>  
One realizes one can't let go of things they've said. 

Forsooth, the voices of the pages have been whispering to my unconcious, <br>  
And at last question meets answer.

I'd been using a crutch to stand; <br>  
One outgrows such things.

And yet the memories circle me as vultures; <br>  
I can't run from the easeness of tender voices, heartbeats, gazes.

My duties in the end call for abortion, <br>  
But I feel as though I were born into a new and unforgiving subjectivity,

To my left, emptiness, to my right, _rien_.

From my first and last breath, <br>  
To my first and last sleep, <br>  
I respire in air exhaled by you,

And in all my dreams we are together, <br>  
Moving through the world as we did, yet better.

"It's not about having someone to love me anymore <br>  
But of gaining riches by being born-again poor."

One must remember: <br>  
_L'avenir dure longtemps_
