*Painter:* <br>  

He saw me there. <br>  
Fuck! Fuck! <br>  
He saw me <br>  
In my stupid stupid trapper hat. 

He laughed at me, <br>  
Because I was on the bike <br>  
In my work clothes, <br>  
Debased, <br>  
Layered and fat and soles falling <br>  
Out everywhere—— <br>  
It's not my fault it's fucking cold! 

He, <br>  
Off to some function or soirée <br>  
Surely <br>  
(He once laughed at my Belvedere!) <br>  
Without a care. 

You oughta <br>  
Tell them <br>  
To let me back into the school. 

*Analyst:* <br>  

I saw him there. <br>  
Hah! Hah! <br>  
I saw him <br>  

In his self-imposed degraded state, <br>  
And he the one told me to wait <br>  
For his tardy and limping pretense nonsense! <br>  
I was too busy, in my office 

Listening and writing over the head <br>  
Of a man who was mute unless while in bed, <br>  
And he tinkered in that which I like to dabble <br>  
(And he wasn't half bad in naught but a towel).

Still, I found nothing to compel him to speak, <br>  
And my failure in turn made me old and quite weak. <br>  
More weak, though, the other's figure rent me: <br>  
So lithe and framed: all that was not sent me.

Enough! let him writhe in his squalor: <br>  
He tried to blame what he did on his Father. <br>  
We must be quick! Autumn is on the wing, <br>  
And I'll be damned if he should bloom again come spring! 

*Vagrant:* <br>  

I am still there, around the river bend <br>  
Or scaled the mountain, high upon the crest. <br>  
The cattle said my offer to rescind: <br>  
That neither of them earned to be my guest. 

We'll trick the painter, let us dress in black <br>  
And, with the newsman, haunt him in his dreams, <br>  
And you, my doctor dear, will also lack, <br>  
For I shall leave you for the glitt'ring streams. 

I am there, telling secrets in the lot, <br>  
Awaiting starlight: savior of half-truths—— <br>  
I'm bitter. All my secrets were forgot. <br>  
I laid them in the crypt, inside their tomb.

And in my goss'mer blouse to see the Duke, <br>  
I stop halfway——beside the creek to puke.
