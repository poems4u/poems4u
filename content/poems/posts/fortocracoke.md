Call did the Major Briggs <br>  
For all the able bodied men. <br>  
He called them to kneel——to dig. <br>  
While cedars trembled in the wind

They sailed their way to Beacon Mound <br>  
To render convex their earthen hole—— <br>  
Built a hollow cone forth the ground <br>  
And desired the Union to lull <br>  

Over the rocky shoals and shallows. <br>  
Savages aground, they'd show themselves, numbered sixty——<br>  
Would defend their island home hallowed <br>  
And slaughter all the enemy. 

But their merucurial minds failed to comprehend <br>  
When fell Hatteras and Roanoake and Macon. <br>  
Without one shot their war found its end—— <br>  
Insignificance——Butler refused to slay them. <br>  

So they packed their bags, their armaments and powder <br>  
And pushed their "fort" into the sea. <br>  
Pamlicoan backwardnes and grief sounded louder <br>  
When the only fantasy failed to be.

They returned to their huts and hovels—— <br>  
They returned to their fishing stations, <br>  
And oyster shells filled what was taken by shovels, <br>  
And they redoubted their tiny nation. 

Some would later fight inland and lose their life, <br>  
So small-scale replicated was the hole as family graves. <br>  
Whence ere now the corpses roll in strife, <br>  
Knowing soon their world reduced to ocean waves.
