"May it please the court, and may I first present <br>  
That Mrs. Babbitt came to The Bay with God's assent. <br>  
In Trump's America, it was allowed <br>   
That Mr. Babbitt be seen as well-endowed <br>  
(Monitarily, of course), and though she was worthless <br>  
Was proud to be named Queen of The Pool Service. <br>   
And when the feds called the loan, she was too retarded <br>  
To make any sense of it, she started <br>  
With the Pizzagate and the cabal, <br>  
And the homeless, immigrants——the wall <br>  
That she climbed——in her pocket a knife, <br>  
And for the brief moment 'fore the end of her life <br>  
She got to feel in charge of her fate; <br>  
A creature so useless been forced to wait <br>  
for any sense of agency, <br>  
Judge, and Michael, y'all know me, <br>  
How I was appointed by Him to know <br>  
The faults and fallings of the masses below. <br>  
We all can see, act of creation aside, <br>  
That it's best for all beings this varmit had died. <br>  
She cowered and raged of her own ineptitude—— <br>  
She never helped one, and when left destitute <br>  
She shrilled her impotent voice—— <br>  
Her Cro-Magnon mind came caught in the noise—— <br>  
No soul, no loss,,,all disgrace—— <br>  
Your Honor, opposing counsel, I rest my case." 

The judge turned to Michael, who, swallowed in thought, <br>  
Stared blankly down upon the evidence he had brought, <br>  
And inside his mind was the consideration <br>  
Of every person, of every nation, <br>  
Of different values, of different words, <br>  
Of countless deaths and several births—— <br>  
He saw two factions——on either side of the street <br>  
Stood them, calling on the others to weep <br>  
For their sins: "They've ruined our country! <br>  
Should they be culled all would be lovely!" <br>  
Sees the blind. <br>  
And so our Michael knew the mind <br>  
Of Sulla, his believers, all their kind: <br>  
Stalin and Robespierre, Sâr and Gonzalo, <br>  
Hitler and Urban II, Polk and Tojo, <br>  
Even Lenin required his Dzerzhinsky—— <br>  
And the angel considered intently <br>  
That Christman would suffer middle-aged stroke, <br>  
That O B would crash out and burn all that he wrote, <br>  
That Lana would marry a crocodile hunter, <br>  
That a boy in Some Place would be torn asunder <br>  
With no recourse as to who or how or why. <br>  
Poor Michael then started to cry <br>  
As he foresaw Buncombe's coming retribution, <br>  
And he was reminded while in state of confusion <br>  
Of his own powerlessness in the face of The Plan <br>  
Which wouldn't let him save a drowning woman or starving man, <br>  
And he saw the place he once knew as Eden <br>  
Washed away, broke down, defeated. <br>  
Former glory must be redoubted, <br>  
So in court he was astounded <br>  
To vision had fallen among the formerly well-known tree. <br>  
Poor Ashli's council could only reply: <br>  

"May God rebuke thee!"
