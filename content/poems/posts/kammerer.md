Are heavy footfalls bleating fast <br>  
This organized a pleated past <br>  
Neat, arranged~~ 

Like those sniveling eyes <br>  
To which history grew wise <br>  
And blew its nose in the river.

Something like ballast in my gut, <br>  
Like if ten thousand peanut nuts <br>  
Were squeezed into a kiss.

It means I cannot leave this earth <br>  
They said was mine on day of birth—— <br>  
It means all y'all are alone.

I said all y'all can have the ocean; <br>  
Best make humiliation motion <br>  
When I come to laugh on Fridays. 

Whisperings of hidden in a book—— <br>  
So no one saw carrion in brook <br>  
With grotesque lips thin smiling:

He was both dead and dying.
