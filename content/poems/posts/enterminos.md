"I knew you would do this to me!

You kept me from the hills of Spain <br>  
and locked up in a book <br>  
to heap desires upon my soul in pain.

You had a joke at me, <br>  
from beyond, <br>  
at my shouts into the black <br>  
which echoed back,

and it split your sides <br>  
to see my eyes <br>  
turned to the skies <br>  
when all the manna farms lay fallow."

"I have not laughed in my entire life—— <br>  

and I know that, once, <br>  
a dark cloud descended down, <br>  
and out stretched a hand holding spatula <br>  
and Burger King crown, 

and you ignored and fear-faltered—— <br>  
I heard you trip and fall at the altar: 

there were hills in your own backyard.

I don't believe you, if you were so worried <br>  
you could've posted Palestine Instagram Stories."
