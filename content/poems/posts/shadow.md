"I was the first to have heard. <br>  
I published the newspapers on that day. <br>  
I was the one they deigned absurd, <br>  
But when the sea parted, who else made way? <br>  
No one else discovered the third <br>  
In King David's little psalms. <br>  
None else flew——two-winged bird—— <br>  
While they had faces in palms. <br>  
When each one in their cowardice deferred, <br>  
Only I dared speak the truth, <br>  
When, as with age, the wisdom was transferred, <br>  
'Twas I who occupied the youth. <br>  
And while the conspirators conferred, <br>  
I laid down to rest. <br>  
My mouth closed, their words slurred—— <br>  
Bedlam by the 'blessed.' <br>  
In every wretch, in every turd, <br>  
There is a little bit of me. <br>  
If ignorant, they've strayed the herd: <br> 
 
Rest assured—— <br>  

They'll see. 

Rest refused to be interred, <br>  
While all the powers oppose—— <br>  
So little can be inferred <br>  
By the findings of the nose, <br>  

But I took care of that, after all; <br>  
I was what they used to write the law.

And it broke my heart when Simon lied <br>  
When simply faced with."

Who am I?
