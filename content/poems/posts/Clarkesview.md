Clarke was wrong about the lottery problem, <br>  
Because he thought we all could win. 

This is of what I was thinking <br>  
When she covered her mouth <br>  
Before collapsing on the floor <br>  
I was thinking what did this <br>  
Get passed the editors. 

I thought it was a prank so I didn't help her,

And I blamed Clarke.
