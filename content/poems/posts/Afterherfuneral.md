The humidity permitted <br>  
The universal dispersal of the static shock <br>  
Abound in the 80 degree November. <br>  

It lept from one drop to another, <br>  
It filled every hole, swallowed every surface, <br>  
Until, at last, it burrowed its way into the secret of the switch, <br>  
And the machine was designated "On." 

Whence did commence the spinning wheels—— <br>  
Manufactory for the armies of fingers <br>  
To group <br>  
To circumscribe <br>  
To collapse <br>  
In searching for bits and pieces emerging from identified individuals: <br>  
In Search of Unification within Formal Guilt. 

Once the crime was then uncovered, <br>  
Each digit took the indivisibility <br>  
And held it in the creation of their hyperstitious cells: <br>  

"They came for me; <br>  
I remember <br>  
They will come for me. <br>  
Hah! <br>  
What fools! <br>  
For here I've already relinquished my physical state. <br>  
Come one and all! <br>  
Come challenge! <br>  
I care not about their whirring drills—— <br>  
My own light to myself is preparing. <br>  
I can feel it tremble <br>  
Of preparation to burst forth its seems <br>  
And anon to where those greedy will never find!"

But we all ate of the same delusion—— <br>  
Already now swim the prions <br>  
As we extract the enjoyment released in the break-up of neural connections. 

Shan't we rather hold hands <br>  
Or try our damndest to scrunch together the few chunks of wet porridge we can all still claim our own? 

"So come on, then. <br>  
I await my sentence. <br>  
Send me somewhere that I may at least enjoy the full echoes of the metal spoon clanging against the edges of my near-empty bowl."
