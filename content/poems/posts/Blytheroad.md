*The trifles of erstwhile class can still explode——* <br>  
*Like that night in 1900, there on Blythe Road,* <br>  
*When the Golden Dawn became an amber dusk,* <br>  
*And all their spells were revealed as dust.* <br>  
*The air was brisk, still the wind,* <br>  
*When the gayest man alive arrived to rescind* <br>  
*The sickly londoners' mandate to throne:* <br>  
*New became the moon, and all light was gone.*

Yeats: <br>  
Look all and laugh, <br>  
For our feeble master's envoy <br>  
Is but a skinny little boy <br>  
In a silly mask!

Would that he wouldn't tarnish the kilt—— <br>  
Through its opening wafts the gonorrhea <br>  
Of a degenerate, who refuses our panacea <br>  
Of uprightness and love towards will. 

Chorus: <br>  
His mask is tufted because he will soon lack hair! <br>  
Push him, shove him, kick him down the stairs! 

Yeats: <br>  
What should he want with our papers? <br>  
They have nothing to do with fellatio. <br>  
He's cleary never read Horatio, <br>  
Nor cares whether 'tis Christ or wafer. 

——Nor do I... but you must see <br>  
I am of obstinance, like Dante or Blake; <br>  
You want to be vulgar but lack status or rank, <br>  
You unbarroned Byron, you Sade *sans* Marquis. 

Chorus: <br>  
He lacks sense, unlike you, who's earned to put on airs. <br>  
Push him, shove him, kick him down the stairs! 

Yeats:<br>  
How dare you come here, you perverted freak, <br>  
Who seeks all our knowledge to turn into jizz? <br>  
They've shown your type before, that which is <br>  
One who says all power but inward is meek. 

Harken, last Trinity man; are you aware <br>  
That this 20th century will never learn your name <br>  
Unless you bear it your prolapsed anus in shame? <br>  
Away to oblivion (they won't have you but there) <br>  
And out from our house!... unless you're prepared <br>  
To be pushed, No, shoved... No. *Kicked* down the stairs! 

Crowley: <br>  
And you: gross old man, <br>  
Who the decrepit 19th century puppets with its hand <br>  
Up your bum! What can tell you me? <br>  
For I see the future, and you'll always be <br>  
The mere footfall on the path to me. <br>  

You'll be posted on twitter, in vile pretense, <br>  
And your stupid moon thing will be blank fired, thus missed. <br>  
A vision, you say? Of naught but the past, <br>  
For in future all will take dicks up the ass! <br>  
You see your low birth and reject such glamor; <br>  
Please, allow me to bring down the hammer <br>  
To bang through your mind that which will come: <br>  
"Do what thou wilt" is the beat of the drum 

Thus, you: gross old man <br>  
The powers conspired to leave out from the plan. <br>  
You will rest on the laurels of a transient state; <br>  
You, who will die, too full to await <br>  
The entrée following your meager Easter plate.  <br>  


"An Irish protestant!" They'll cry, "How queer! <br>  
We've never seen anything like that around here!" <br>  
Meanwhile, they'll live in a world made by us; <br>  
They'll fuck in the park and fuck on the bus. <br>  
To them, you'll be nothing but an effete who lied, <br>  
Who kept among the living MacDonagh and MacBride. <br>  
You, on whose corpse they won't deign to gnaw, <br>  
Because "Do what thou wilt" shall be all of the law! 

Blake: <br>  
Oh, My God! How they fight and bicker <br>  
Over enochian nonsense——that wretched Dee <br>  
Turned wildfire minds into a mere flicker. <br>  
Oh, why in my name must the foolishness be? 

'Twas but a story, a symbol, an image! <br>  
Thel is not real! I must've gone wrong! 
Smite them, oh Lord! They don't see me in scrimmage!

Jesus: <br>  
You're lucky to be here; get back to our song. 

Steiner: <br>  
But, what about me? I'm still alive! <br>  
I deserve more than them for my name to be known! <br>  
Not just poetry, but schools and farms from mine! 

Goethe: <br>  
And you crucified me on top of the dome.
