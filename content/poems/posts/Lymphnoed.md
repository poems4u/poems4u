I never want to take my medicine, <br>  
Cuz then I'm too sick to write—— <br>  
Too believed my feigned intelligence <br>  
When with my body I pick a fight. 

When spit, like truth, becomes hard to swallow, <br>  
And fatigue replaces rage—— <br>  
When, with my own nausea, I can cease to borrow <br>  
Others' vomit on the page. 

But I live in a place with hundreds of peepholes, <br>  
And Tanya tell me the news <br>  
(And sorry to the Mexican who shared my needles, <br>  
Cuz HIV is coming soon). <br>  

Unknown lives and deaths <br>  
In the bricks AND in the abodes—— <br>  
May the wauss enjoy his final breaths <br>  
Before the abdomen is removed. 

Some crackheads have a patron saint <br>  
Who lives and walks among us—— <br>  
God's kingdom she does not await <br>  
(My throat is filled with virus).

P.S. 

Oh! And sorry to the schizophrenic wizard <br>  
Who I moved in to stalk. <br>  
Once I read enough Gadamer <br>  
I'll replace him with his walk.
