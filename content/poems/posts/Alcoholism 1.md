Somehow, the mullet breached the sea wall <br>  
To terrorize the neighborhood with their squelching—— <br>  
Constantly sucking debris into their maws, <br>  
And the endemic AC hum isn't helping. <br>  

Another night sat illicitly, <br>  
As the school sought to swallow <br>    
One half of symmetry. <br>  
Reflected on the lake within the hollow

Was a brightly lit home partitioned by palm. <br>  
Subtle piano notes sounded about the air, <br>  
But those frenzied fish disquited the calm—— <br>  
A thought was inserted: it wasn't fair <br>  

That nobody told Narcissus <br>  
That what he saw was something other. <br>  
And nobody told the fishes <br>  
That algal blooms them would smother. 

And nobody told me <br>  
That Dionysus snuck in through the back. <br>  
All was handled it seemed, <br>  
'Til suddenly resounded a whack! 

Thence were two figures—— <br>  
One kneeled over, the other holding her up; <br>  
Fall risks misfigured <br>  
When none have wine left in the cup. 

How could one even bring a pinecone to South Flordia? <br>  
Now that is dedication! <br>  
It was an ironic miracle, like the menorah, <br>  
That _he_ withstood inebriation. 

Why's it matter to have burning oil anyway? <br>  
I'd rather have fish and bread——and drink! <br>  
Whence he laughed——rod and staff would stay <br>  
As I spewed $350 into the sink.
