It's something like losing your leg; <br>  
So you must learn to walk without it. <br>  

And it gets to a point where grief is of no useâ€” <br>  
A one legged man you are. <br>  
It makes little difference to the truth; <br>  
Besides, nothing can be done. 

But there are still those nights, <br>  
Just before sleep, <br>  
When you hope, <br>  
Maybe even believe, <br>  
That the miracle will be you. 

You'll wake with firm foot <br>  
And run in ecstasy to the kitchen <br>  
Or the living room <br>  
Or porch, <br>  
To holler: <br>  
"Hallelujah!"
