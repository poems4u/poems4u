A man was born into this curse-d earth <br>  
Within full sin, without the means to know <br>  
How to begin his lifelong mortal search <br>  
For the sole soul who *chose* to come below.

The brokenness within he did not want, <br>  
Nor to be trapped inside a body seen <br>  
By those all those, too, who, blind within the haunt <br>  
Know not the spectres tied inside machines. 

But He went down beseeching him to hear <br>  
The music that is played beyond his realm: <br>  
At length from God's when matter comes more dear: <br>  
his ship of death——he must give up the helm 

To Him who made the world but dwelt not in <br>  
Until he made it known whose fault was sin.
