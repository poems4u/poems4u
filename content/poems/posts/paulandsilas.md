Ensouled Encaged <br>  

Rotting and heavy—— <br>  
In every instance an immense aching for rest <br>  
And <br>  
Settlement. 

I wouldn't dream of singing. <br>  

Rather, I should be a leaf in the <br>  
(How long will the [Wind.] blow?)

Or should like to burrow or claw a way from out my skin <br>   
And fly away to the moon <br>  

Or even yonder and on, <br>  

Up where the eye knows but cannot see, <br>  

Where the assemblage rock of rocks and minerals, <br>  
Which we call inhabitance, <br>  

Would only will to oblige <br>  
And collapse:

So I wouldn't dream of singing.
