I thought.

When the call to flip the burgers came, <br>  
i would go on, <br>  
resigned and do the damn thing.

The birds in the sky answer to no one; <br>  
they don't grin at pejoratives from those they devour. <br>  
They go out into a world where <br>  
their life is simply hiding. <br>  

In various places they <br>  
aren't told to stay. <br>  
In a box to eat <br>  
or that they musn't <br>  
sing or sing <br>  
one tune.

Gulping pride, <br>  
i've tried to idly listen <br>  
to fools who don't know <br>  
nothing about anything. 

Tell me how to dress and talk and stand and fold and smile. 

Meanwhile, my vast worlds'll be <br>  
smothered within me, and i'll do it myself, <br>  
and they'll rot after me.

Stretched out impossibly thin between <br>  
centuries and words,

and the slave drivers can't remember.

What happened five years ago?
