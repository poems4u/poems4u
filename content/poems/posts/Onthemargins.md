That's me in the pocket:

Losing my castration <br>  
To the sipping pool table swingers,

Dying in four four time, <br>  
Oh and four for the cat shit under my nails,

Watching then be fruitful and <br>  
multiply my twenty second year of fallow,

Losing my decision <br>  
To Christ and to Maggie,

Leading what few into the nettle and chai—— <br>  
Mutinied into home 

Trembling with Father's hand <br>  
In grasp——I will miss you—— <br>  
And an old lady snatches him <br>  
To where he'd rather be,

Laying down my head, <br>  
Laying down my arms, 

Losing <br>  
The listless battles. 

Until I awake on the golf course <br>  
Built over the dank pit of dreams.

The water rushes <br>  
The frog's call. <br>  
The cart path cracks <br>  
The moon's shine <br>  
Through the thinning crowns.
