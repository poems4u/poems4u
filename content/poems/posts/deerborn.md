&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *To the tune of "Say, Brothers, Will You Meet Us"*

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the making of the Ford! <br>  
He went out there to Arche and invited her on board. <br>  
He wished he was to dancing as the Khan was to the Sword: <br>  
All the things he knew are gone! 

Glory, Glory, etc..

Except, I meant to say, that which we know will always* be here: <br>  
The thunder, eyes of State, the het-ro-dox, and, yes, the queer, <br>  
The bug that travels to the brain on open* canals of ears: <br>  
The rest we knew is gone!

Glory, Glory, etc..

The men who write the fact'ries, build the laws, and hire the crew <br>  
Will find that they destroyed that what their poor minds had in view, <br>  
And some will seek to shape the world on what they thought was new, <br>  
But what they wanted* is gone!

Glory, Glory, etc..

And when, on the horizon, I'll the last time rouse from bed <br>  
And see that my old landlord's come a-knockin' for my head, <br>  
I'll holler for the children, tell them "run and get the reds!" <br>  
But they've since all marched along!

Glory, Glory, etc..
