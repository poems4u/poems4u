I never got fisted by a stranger in the airport bathroom 

I never slept with a man 20+ years my senior 

I never had a gender or a identity 

I never been to the Iowa Riders Workshop

I never sat on a plane crossed the Atlantic 

I never *was* sent to jail (they tried)

I never received sympathy from all the eyes that could be made to look 

I never took a antidepressant 

I never won any race I started 

I never found that sui-generis ability to be proven through and through 

I never completed my ones and twos 

I never got my package 

I never slept alone 

I never had that which was freely given, <br>  
until so compelled 

I did have, though, in every season, <br>  
one friend or another 

And, once, mired in the Olympian fen, <br>  
I saw a secret

Guarded on all sides by that perpetual engulfing moss, 

Whose hosts' unrelenting greens 

Deigned not to tell me what it means.

But they did say:

"What seems near is far away. <br>  
The secret just revealed to you <br>  
Is closer: in a thicket of kudzu. <br>  
It can be rediscovered, but ne'er spoke."

And it burrows deeper with every toke, <br>  
I later found.
