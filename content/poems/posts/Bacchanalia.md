Did arrive the fawns with horn resound <br>  
After fared was paid <br>  
Docetic shapes emerged forth the ground <br>  
Cornerstones got laid <br>  

'Cuz Dr. Bacchus and his wife <br>  
(Astrologically Virgin) <br>  
Had exited this foreign life <br>  
And faced themselves as surgeons <br>  

Scalpels circulated bout the air <br>  
And pain bisected without care <br>  
To find there was nothing in the middle <br>  

"And though the spiders itched us as riddles, <br>  
Still was planned the wedding feast <br>  
Which had taken place upon Swiss Alps. <br>  
From our hearts had come the yeast <br>  
Which bubbled our absent doubts, <br>  
And we knew——we saw who would be there! <br>  
A list of names too long to write: <br>  
As many heads as they're our hairs—— <br>  
My husband and Vierge's bride. <br>  
Our Lord was peaked just 'yond the wall, <br>  
And smiled the pictures we were draw," <br>  

But back was turned when death came 'pon them <br>  
They learned the feet are at the bottom <br>  

They learned to damp for decompose and sag <br>  
That which was transcended then coming back <br>  
Abstraction must revert immediacy <br>  
So future tears were shed immediately <br>  

Painful transition was all <br>  
Was fine <br>  
But lucidity was spun <br>  
Was spent to dust <br>  
 
Burgeoning and becoming <br>  
Can grow <br>  
Wearisome and heavy <br>  

The Leaves Must Be Shed
