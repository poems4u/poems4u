When the Nation's day is finally done, <br>  
And the Rockefellers have no more fun, <br>  
And the fever finds its source, <br>  
And the project runs its course: <br>  

None will weep at America's last breath, <br>  
When the yoeman-bourgeois reaches its death. <br>  
If mine's been beaten, enslaved, riddled with strife, <br>  
Why shouldn't yours end early? You've had an air conditioner your whole life.
