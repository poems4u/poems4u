"Geez, Mary, can't you tell a good idol from a poor idol? <br>  
There's plenty of fine wood and stone available; <br>  
*Those* materials have much more grounded aesthetic precedent anyway! <br>  
I'm so confused... do they even *make* graven images out of flesh and blood?"

Inscribed in body of the blest North Star: <br>  
The promissory note, which still doth read <br>  
In future that all debt be burned by fire <br>  
And smashed to sand by force majeure of sea––

It, scattered all about our hopeful world, <br>  
Becomes the very thing which makes it up. <br>  
Star shineth still on all: those rich *and* churled. <br>  
May 'member we to look down on our luck 

Just once a year. The other days, then, doubt <br>  
The guarantor who chose to come and say, <br>  
At risk of death and pain and tiring out: <br>  
"Your hope should fly to me on Christmas Day;

Aghast to coin and dirt, today enlivened you can be. <br>  
This once-a-year, go throw it all away to rest in me."

I'll never know what Will depraved <br>  
Would *choose* to come be birthed in cave <br>  
And leave His throne in heaven bright <br>  
To chill and tremble in the night. <br>  

He loved you more than e'er He should <br>  
('Tis I, not Him, who lost you in the wood <br>  
So bleak). Just keep of this ere all: <br>  
'Twas only one could hope to break the Law.
