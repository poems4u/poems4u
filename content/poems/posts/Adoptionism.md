Gyorg sniggers from the depths, <br>  
hidden in a forest <br>  
of unyielding stalks—– <br>  
rejecting all sight <br>  
and light: <br>  
but his eyes adjust. 

From the hilltop, <br>  
outside forsaken town, <br>  
the trees are begged to clear <br>  
so as to see the laughs of <br>  
the rolling earth <br>  
frozen in space, <br>  
not time. 

Faith *could* move a mountain, <br>  
but it won't.

And if the abyss around <br>  
which identity comports <br>  
was found filled—— <br>  
even on a cloudy winter's morn, <br>  
when the gray streets are <br>  
irrevocably empty, <br>  
and the universally chosen <br>  
stillness <br>  
relinquishes the geography—— <br>  
I *know* you would dig it up again.

So, yes, <br>  
we can fathom how he felt <br>  
to leave his comrades <br>  
and away alone to the garden <br>  
to have the chill upon his skin—— <br>  
but to love lack with <br>  
clarity such as his: <br>  
this is incomprehensible. 

Though my deceitful despair <br>  
assembles the hands <br>  
, each night while I rest, <br>  
to arrange some new <br>  
unsolvable problematic, <br>  
the body adjacent conjures <br>  
an attempting chain: <br>  
But You Were Published Just Two Weeks Ago: <br>  
Two Weeks? <br>  
Two Weeks? <br>  
Lies, Fibs, <br>  
And Nonsense, <br>  
As If My Provincial Manners <br>  
Weren't Born Till Yesterday <br>  
Or Tomorrow.
