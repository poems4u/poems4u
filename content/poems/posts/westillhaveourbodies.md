Though lack——indeed——inserted there <br>  
We still could find our way. <br>  
The preparation strectching show <br>  
Would not be won that day.

But my tripartite spirit likes <br>  
All touching and caress, <br>  
And if the motion felt so good, <br>  
My astral left this mess. 

Two bodies thus transcend their realm—— <br>  
It sent me through the stars. <br>  
The Texans tried but could not stop <br>  
Two rocketships to Mars! 

And please forgive my thinly veiled <br>  
Perverted _enchanté_. <br>  
Cosmosis could be done alone <br>  
But better _d'à côté_.
