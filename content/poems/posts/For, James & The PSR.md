A swift flick, swerve <br>  
Placed us here <br>  
In this grey-washed atrium <br>  
watching television on the <br>  
floor- they gave us nowhere to sit. <br>  

Even in that moment I felt <br>  
a strange lilt in my heart.<br>  

Two bulls: <br>  
dumb, headstrong, naive, smug, <br>  
stubborn, and born with a <br>  
recalcitrant need to be known <br>  
made use of, and loved. <br>  

 Oceans in our eyes <br>  
and rainforests in our hearts. <br>  

Besides that, nothing in common. <br>  
But still, you saw me smile <br>  
and wheeled or wobbled over <br>  
to attend to me. <br>  

Last I saw you, it was there, <br>  
with that poor, poor girl <br>  
(elle, elle est morte <br>  
elle est morte <br>  
et lorsque tu te rends ce compte...) <br>  
And there were bugs under <br>  
my skin. <br>  

And you told me of my future

And hung your head
 
And asked if I forgave you 

I said yes, and meant it - <br>  
that's why I haven't called since
