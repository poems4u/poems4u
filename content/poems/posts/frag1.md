Then was reckoning, 

In the still and hollow night <br>  
We saw stray cats and hooting owls, <br>  
And from the chords of your guitar <br>  
A seismic force shook the world. 

Buildings burned; people screamed; regimes collapsed. <br>  
The smell of blood + fire took my nostrils.

I fell on my broken knees. <br>  
A brick split upon my head. <br>  
Ash clouded my eyes. <br>  

The unanimous groans of a condemned world <br>  
Could not drown your voice. <br>  

And all I could do was weep.
