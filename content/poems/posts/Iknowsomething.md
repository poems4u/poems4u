"The pulse returns for prodigal suns <br>  
Who hid themselves in the deep covet of a darkened cloud, <br>  
Refusing rejoinder for those things thought out loud. <br>  

And they were cached there of their own selfish wants <br>  
When four little children began drowning at once. <br>  
They went untried for their crimes -- no one saw them <br>  
Because rays of light found four bodies at the bottom. <br>  

And no matter the memories of the secrets stashed there sliced and sewn up, <br>  
Because the body, <br>  
Every time, <br>  
Forgets out of pure frustration <br>  
At its sensations <br>  
Anesthetized, <br>  
While the digits of demons deposit eggs that when grown up <br>  
Too remember nothing of the host's consummate constipation. <br>  

And while those hated hands had their way with organs <br>  
Our solar spectators did nothing but watch <br>  
As innards ate outards, had their fill, more than <br>  
Enough; choral screams chased with scotch <br>  

To make them all the more appealing. <br>  
Unlike a lone firefly appearing <br>  
So long away from dusk, <br>  
Much before it must. <br>  

And all the periodicals have gone <br>  
As stifling summer settles in. <br>  
Mimosas bloom, but no more song <br>  
As we end there only to begin: <br>  
I know something's very wrong." <br>
