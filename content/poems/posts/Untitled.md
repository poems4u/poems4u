He was taken <br>  
Lifted into the sky <br>  
And was replaced with <br>  
a copy <br>  

The copy looked and sounded like him <br>  
and kept up the ruse for awhile <br>  
sweet + tender, delicate like a <br>  
lily in the cold <br>  
grew legs and ran to the <br>  
top of the mountain, <br>  
and threw itself off <br>  

tumbled down <br>  
holes in leaves <br>  
Flowers left in disarray all behind <br>  
for the hooves of bulls to later <br>  
trample as they try in vain <br>  
to pick them up with their teeth, <br>  
Lucky ones digested <br>  

once he grabbed her by the hair, <br>  
led her outside to shrieks + hollers <br>  
a crowd formed <br>  
Booing and gnashing teeth <br>  
she was gnashed in turn <br>  
and so the choir found themselves <br>  
too <br>  
gnashed at once all together <br>  

in inexplicable violence <br>  
that night they took the copy back <br>  
and the original was returned <br>  
with memories formed <br>  
by the bubbling of Alka-Seltzer <br>  
in stomach acid <br>  

And as it bubbled, <br>  
his hands grew to the size of stones, <br>  
whence he had to drag <br>  
forever <br>
