One realizes when they go out west. <br>  
That so many have never seen a real southern belle twink before. <br>  
A prophet is never recognized is his own home, at best, <br>  
And so i like to see things I’ve never seen before. <br>  

The south is so provincial in ways we often forget. <br>  
Here, it’s a phone booth every couple blocks, most neighborhoods have a community garden, <br>  
Sundry others which beget, <br>  
Freedom, but somehow, with such amenities, hearts harden. <br>  

We don’t quite know why, but despite <br>  
Spinning signs and sky trams and queers and vegans <br>  
And $18 cocktails they put on fire and police that are lenient, <br>  
Most find the ground more enlivening than the city’s light. <br>  

Still, there’s something about riding the light-rail 50 minutes to the “beach.” <br>  
Wait, sorry, that was in Wilmington, in the 1920s— Lumina. <br>  
Sauvie Island isn’t something they’ll have you reach <br>  
Lest you’re a corpse floating down the Columbia. <br>  

So y’all can keep y’all’s sidewalks and y’all’s prosperity and pride. <br>  
I’ll take the Corpus Christi procession on Fordham Boulevard. <br>  
I’ll take the haziness, the laziness, the gloom of gazes that wish to deride <br>  
Me. In exchange I’ll get something vague about a bahia’d summer yard. <br>

And it often makes me sad <br>  
That folks would rather stay inside. <br>  
I like TV, but also being bad <br>  
And seeking the encounter with that from which they hide. <br>  

Solemnly slovenly, i met a bumblebee on the porch, <br>  
Seeking respite while the devil beat on his wife. <br>  
I told her about going to church, <br>  
And she told me about her life, <br>  

Which was really quite contained, <br>  
But she knew of those who lived in a place <br>  
Where you could hear the flowers gossip. <br>  
Where, in a certain stillness, you could see the meeting of the four winds, <br>  
Could go from whence the sky and sea blossom, <br>  
Or spend a long time finding a hermit or a tree <br>  
To convince <br>  
To share the knowledge that be <br>  
In the heart of that not often sought, <br>  
Neither within a mirror, nor something bought. <br>  

And that damn bastard old fucking crow jeered and hollered <br>  
As i maniacally drew up my plans. <br>  
He knew others couldn’t be bothered <br>  
By the wild waving and gesturing of my hands. <br>  

My bee friend bade me the end fared-well <br>  
As I lumbered back onto the screen. <br>  
Despite my best efforts, I couldn’t tell <br>  
Why that damn old rotten crow had to be so mean. <br>

And there will come a day, <br>  
When youth will pass away. <br>  
What will they say <br>  
About me? <br>
