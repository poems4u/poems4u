Lord, in your wisdom you made the rain—— <br>  
So often a necessary inconvenience; <br>  
You decided to make the reign <br>  
(Of A. Spirit, that is) <br>  
So often a necessary inconvenience. 

You included mosquitoes and cockroaches in your plan. <br>  
You set the heavenly bodies in motion—— <br>  
At times agreeing, <br>  
At times disagreeing. 

My God, you created every living and "non-living" thing with purpose; <br>  
In our iniquity and ignorance before you we are worthless. <br>  
Devant toi, nous nous devenons comme des fourmis. <br>  
Dans ton monde, seigneur, nous sommes les touristes—— <br>  
We can only stay but for awhile; <br>  
On holiday one may as well smile.  

Lord, in your providence please hear me well, <br>  
And my petition that all he-crabs may comfortably shed their shells. <br>  

Help the freaks and the perverts, O Lord, to find good company. <br>  
Help the psychotics, O Lord, to find good company. <br>  
Help the felons, O Lord, to find good company. 

Help the dull and the retards, O Lord, to find good company. <br>  
Help the capitalists, O Lord, to have good company. <br>  
Help the artists, O Lord, to find good company. 

Help the sick and starving, O Lord, to find good company. <br>  
Help the prohpets, O Lord, to have good company. <br>  
Help all difference, O Lord, to find like company. 

Please help, O Lord, the flotsam and jetsam awash on the shore. <br>  
Please help all those who've never been to Earth before. <br>  
And may Descartes finally find his reward.
