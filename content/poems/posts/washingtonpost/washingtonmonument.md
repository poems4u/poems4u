The three open Sildenafil pit mines <br>  
in three seperate Republics unionized 

are now a more costly investiture—— <br>  
the miners unionized.

So, the increasing expenditures to hold <br>  
the one big, beautiful erection—— <br>  
the thickest in the world, <br>  
the rival of the nations—— <br>  
will take half a century to arouse, <br>  
but once he sees the pacific rim <br>  
spread open and throbbing, <br>  
full mast for good,

A. Blinken can sit slightly forward, <br>  
hand eternally enclosed around a <br>  
phantom phallus he wished his own,

until the Ellipse boundary finally <br>  
pushes past to the Basin and Potomac—— <br>  
the voyeurs dispersed—— <br>  
so all seven can be alone <br>  

and play comparison with their father <br>  
whose children they are not.

Those who are <br>  
those who lost <br>  
their erection abilities <br>  
in the underground asphyxiation aforementioned <br>  
or the Cialis Conflict, <br>  
as it will come to be known in labor history.
