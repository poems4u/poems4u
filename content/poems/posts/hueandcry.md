~~Dear, Abby~~

"What do a woman and a plane have in common?" <br>  

Isn't it strange what we choose to make into spectacles?

Abstraction is your friend! <br>  
So is mystery. <br>  
Blurry...  <br>  

An essay can be a poem. <br>  
A memoir cannot. 


An aphorism and an ever present question, <br>  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What Would You Do <br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If When You Okay <br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So He Said Yes Would Go?"
