It's after the end of the world, don't you know that yet? 

Since 33, most have believed the Apocalypse would come in their lifetime. <br>  
It's probably because when something ends, it is then finished, <br>  
And finished things will no longer produce novelty. <br>  
Admittedly, most of this Planet's novelty is bleak—— <br>  
How often immense hope is co-opted by the forces of fear <br>  
To _end_ in failure. <br>  
So too History must end, <br>  
But it came before thyme and after singing; <br>  
In this life it ain't no Burger Kinging—— <br>  
After it went John P's Way, the truth we did forget. <br>

Seeing Behemoth and Leviathan in the Food Lion self-checkout causes me no alarm, <br>  
Neither does <br>  
Beast 666, <br>  
Mycellic Macro-Fascism, <br>  
Senatorial Simony, <br>  
My Foreskin, <br>  
The Canaanite Pantheon, <br>  
The Beats, <br>  
Fort Hill, <br>  
Trapper Nelson, <br>  
The Tortured Poets Dept., <br>  
Enriched Flour, <br>  
Deli Meat, <br>  
And The One Basquiat Copy (of many), <br>  
For sale on the shelves, <br>  
Discounted, even, if you jumped through some hoops, <br>  
Because I know the one thing you cannot lose: <br>  
Your soul, and all transience which brings it to regret.
