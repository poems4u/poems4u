*Slick black shoes* <br>  
*And pince-nez dreams* <br>  
*From way there yon* <br>  

---

They killing each other— <br>  
Cracked cross the head <br>  
All twisted and dropped. <br>  

And the searing midnight star <br>  
Shows Red the spectacle, too <br>  
The throng whooping and heaving <br>  

Them down there, <br>  
Forging their proper vision, <br>  

Until it’s done, <br>  
Scapegoats slaughtered <br>  

And the piercest howl <br>  
Throngs the town ; <br>  

Centuries of lust <br>  
And into one voice <br>  
Who found God <br>  
Cowering, sniveling in the hole <br>  
And did the Sirte bayonetting <br>  

---

Before the guttural jubilation, <br>  
Or the final conflict <br>  
A posted sign read <br>  
It opens here <br>  
When it happens. <br>  

So some fled and poured out the doors, <br>  
Streaming <br>  
Them, in their rags <br>  
And caravans <br>  
And let the fire fall like limp wrists <br>  
To rather see the still pool of stars <br>  
And sigh, there’s prattle <br>  
And silently, in each head <br>  
Already a loss. <br>  
A secret, and, yes, <br>  
When they got there <br>  
(And sine mistook it for a <br>  
Real movement) <br>  
A note lay, <br>  
And it’s shout was ours :

Arrived too soon <br>  
To see the birth of the new order <br>  
Which really *was* bought <br>  
On credit.
