Lois found out she has brain cancer <br>  

, so, she's in the corner with <br>  
her husband, away from the <br>  
concourse of persons <br>  
nearly obstructing the <br>  

catechist's proceedings. 

Fr. Nick is away <br>  
too, surely holding <br>  
his eyes in his hands 

in another room. 

René is to be crucified <br>  
, as if dissolving the parts <br>  
detracted from the <br>  
mysterious hole. 

It's the sixth jurisdiction to try him, <br>  
but I asked a question——

Time was not permitting

, and I didn't leave; <br>  
I showed my best assent, <br>  

But I loved him, <br>  
because he stepped out of <br>  
time to walk with <br>  
me in the garden. 

They <br>  
(if you can forgive me) <br>  
placed the scalpel of <br>  
modernity in his <br>  
fist and found <br>  
him near the crime

, though, maybe <br>  
(if you can forgive me) <br>  
, that cell in Toledo could <br>  
've had a <br>  
reinforced lock. 

So, after <br>  
the cessation——where <br>  

the living inherited the <br>  
beleaguered and lugubrious <br>  
breaths

——I started away <br>  

——from that man with <br>  
the same tears as <br>  
Ganesh's mother, <br>  
and Kelly's heart <br>  
passed the wall——

to the centenarian. 

I grabbed him by the lapels of <br>  
his space robe <br>  
and spat in his face, <br>  
because his Dawn had past

away. I shook him so violently that <br>  
his feeble neck snapped <br>  
, and his head smiled at the ground, 

and the thud rang resound <br>  
of a love without end: <br>   
"for sure He's your friend!"
