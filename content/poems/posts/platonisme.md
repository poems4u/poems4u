If beauty has one immutible, intersubjective quality, <br>  
is is transience. <br>  
Like a lightning bolt from above, it flashes for but an instance in the grand scheme of things, <br>  
and then it is gone... <br>  

On Friday, I passed it in its sublimity. <br>  
Halted in my tracks as if it were a wall. <br>  
On Monday, in its place was death, decay, disgust, dread. <br>  
I covered my mouth and ran just to trip and fall, to lie there, in that salinity, prostrate, for some time. <br>  

Today, I went back. <br>  
Even in my abject despair I felt that the outline which held such a delicate quality should be revered, remembered. <br>  

I was scared and unprepared, armed with only paper towel and plastic bag, but no one else took notice, and so the task fell to me. <br>  
Now there's dirt under my fingernails...

Could such a thing exist external to finitude? <br>  
Only the philosopher knows.
If we could just ask him, maybe he would say <br>  
there really is an eternal beauty in itself, <br>  
up there, and if you're good, after you leave you can see it. <br>  
You'll sit there smiling, sighing next to Diotima, forever.

Or, she would simply remind us that if it can be lost, <br>  
it was never really ours to begin with.
