D'abord, c'était un bordeaux—— <br>   
Still tastes the same with rain water, you know? <br>  
So we sat with wet hair on the misty roof <br>   
Looking for beautiful horses, looking for proof. 

"We" knew nothing, but eye had all veracity <br>   
Of liking this boy who emerged from his mouse hole to walk in the rain; <br>   
He was tender and sweet, complete with the sagacity <br>   
Of a serial killer——he showed me his collection of frozen brains. 

So there we watched, high above the thrall, <br>   
Waiting and waiting 'til we finally saw <br>   
A vision, from another dimension <br>   
A unity of opposites, lacking contention. 

There, under a known moon, <br>   
Michael Jordan played basketball with cartunes, <br>   
And we giggled at what none other could see: <br>   
A world, despite all odds, which would be complete.
