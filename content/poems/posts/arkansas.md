aunt Diane's big day! <br>  

those little bits bits of stone and debris—— <br>  
when emitted past in excess—— <br>  
can start to look like static <br>  
; rods and cones refuse array. <br>  
*the* ray from Bentonville is scrambled: <br>  

aunt Diane cooks eggs with milk <br>  
and made an omelette <br>  
something wraughtten. <br>  

she couldn't hear tears, <br>  
because ingridients can't cry <br>  
unless they're dissasembled on live television. 

Walton woke and decided <br>  
to project a vision <br>  
that day: <br>  
Mike Warner's unforgettable viral tuna melt moment <br>  
Mike Warner's abominable <br>  
abhorrent sandwich will set the internet aflame. <br>  
Walton will miss Mike Warner's tuna melt viral video.

moment <br>  
locked in the central Arkansas chamber <br>  
and sent thirteen years into the future <br>  
to super-impose on the Taconic. 

aunt Diane's laconic <br>  
phone call <br>  
is still held——<br>  
is still being held <br>  
at the checkpoint.

she is there on the phone. <br>  
she is *not* in the van. <br>  

someone else is driving 

the kids——the beam it sees <br>

senator Warner's big day! <br>  
Mike better Warner! <br>  
Mike Warner cooks eggs with shells. <br>  
Mike Warner is driving the van with the kids, <br>  
and he wonders what must've got in the water <br>  
here. he thinks he is victoria. <br>  
he thinks he is viceroy. 

he remembers locked in a cell in Toledo, <br>  
but he is in Bentonville <br>  
in the beam 
*is* the beam. 

he's never much thought <br>  
such tuna melt tears—— 

it will go viral.

as in caught. 

"Bird flew." <br>  
"where?" <br>  
"away. thirty four." <br>  
"i'm leaving the East Village; <br>  
i'm taking the Taconic——"

they saw out and away, <br>  
and when they see senator Warner on <br>  
his Lost Highway <br>  
they condemn his uncultre: <br>  
He Doesn't Wash Raw Chicken.

they are ejected into <br>  
his Mental Health World, <br>  

and an egg is laid in Arkansas.
