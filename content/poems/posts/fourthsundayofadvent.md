They run amok all o’er the land. <br>  
They leave us not but strife. <br>  
I so pronounce end times at hand <br>  

To live alone this brutish life <br>  
With them who speak but naught. <br>  
Cut out your tongue with bladed knife <br>  

That, aye, not you may speak as ought! <br>  
A triple crown with smiles <br>  
Unlocks all that: what they had sought; <br>  

But, aye, reject the earthen wiles <br>  
Of him who does must play. <br>  
Two worldly feet stamp in the styles <br>  

On us, the dumb, this latter day. <br>  
Not in the pearly gates <br>  
Is where his brazen keys hold sway: <br>  

His legs to wooden doors doth gait <br>  
To show his hoarded stash. <br>  
But we, the mute, know here, in wait, <br>  
That soon his teeth will gnash. <br>

1500 years later, <br>  
Now locked up in a box am I <br>  
In a land I never knew existed. <br>  

All kinds of people do gaze <br>  
And bow their humble heads <br>  
To my tooth <br>  

Ensconced in glass in glass. <br>  
Better yet than then, <br>  
Now silent I can be, <br>  

And never must I move again. <br>  
And smiling above me, <br>  
(As she’s wont to do) <br>  

Is that same material and language <br>  
Of the Donation <br>  
Which I caused to future vision <br>  

And withdraw to beg forgiveness for being a part of <br>  
What I saw was coming. <br>  
Because of it they filled my chalice with poison <br>  
But failed to pull my tooth now beheld <br>  

In North Carolina.
