A diverted interlude, <br>  
Sheltered in the covet <br>  
Of a slanted tree, <br>  
Which ran up to my ankles.

Actually, it was two. <br>  
One which covered half,<br>  
And the other, <br>  
Which grew almost parallel <br>  
To the flowing glass, <br>  
Before curving up from the bank. 

He then sloped down and <br>  
Placed a foot on the riverbed, <br>  
Completing the aforementioned—— <br>  
Covet in pavilion style. 

And if one were to grow <br>  
Brave and step <br>  
Out from the denier <br>  
Of the Sun's patterns <br>  
Into the carcinogenic light, 

They would see <br>  
A clear soil which held <br>  
Tall and bush patches of grass <br>  
And the sidelining trees making <br>  
A line of demarcation for <br>  
Pure fleuvian beauty. 

They too would see <br>  
The cradle—— <br>  
The parabola binding a <br>  
Non-turbid sky and its whitewater—— <br>  
Where our brother the Sun could each dusk <br>  
Rest his heavy neck.
