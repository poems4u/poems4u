Three of us in the tub <br>  
On the side of the stage. 

The pastor, my father, a drowned wolf spider, and I, <br>  

Who, with wandering eye,<br>  
Did declare 

"Im sorry you drowned, man." 

"Oh, no, <br>  
It's quite alright! <br>  
See, I did this on purpose. <br>  
I grew lost in these immense halls, where reside few flies or other crawling/flying pests. <br>  
I've become weak and weary. <br>  
Endeavored and convicted I had adhered well to His plan for me, I drowned myself in this holy water, so that I may too join in beatitude and sing of all creation and substance." 

"Aw, man, <br>  
This isn't holy water. <br>  
We're in a non-denominational mega-church, dude."

"Oh... dear... <br>  
Lord, I have done nothing than what you have intended for me. <br>  
I spun webs——I too created. <br>  
And have taken in supply of sundry subsistence as to what you have deemed fit for my creature. <br>  
... <br>  
Anywhow, I should at least be happy to make it to the Rainbow Bridge——seeing as I have no soul and such..." 

"I mean, well, <br>  
If you made it there, what would you even do? <br>  
Like, you won't be able to catch flies or, like, fuck and make baby spiders."

"Oh... well, <br>  
I could surely spin webs and wander about without fear of predation. <br>  
I would respire without worry. <br>  
And I'll visit with my hundreds of children who number in the count of faithful arachnids. <br>  
I should even wait for you, and we'll converse and laugh without fear of one another."

"I mean, I don't know how to respond to that... <br>  
Like, the Rainbow Bridge isn't real. <br>  
Some white lady made it up to neuroticize children into the old question of animals and if they have souls." 

"Oh... my... <br>  
Where am I going, then?"

"Well, I mean... <br>  
I don't really know." 

"Oh...Lord..."

"Well... Um, <br>  
Did you vote?"

"No. <br>  
There is no worldy authority.<br>  
There is no King of Israel. <br>  
Our High Priest is here, but he only appears to very special people and never to spiders. <br>  
So I reject all confusion of mass morality and material concerns. <br>  
Moreover, animals have very few rights in this country—–I am inelligable for citizenship."

"Oh, yeah, <br>  
Um, do you know where we are?"

"Morgan Street, <br>  
We're on Morgan Street."

"Aw... Geez... <br>  
No man, I'm sorry; we're in Wilmington, North Carolina."

"No sir, <br>  
I believe you're mistaken in this instance. <br>  
We are surely in St. Louis, Missouri, on Morgan Street. <br>  
Can you not see? <br>  
We're in an old shack with a piano."
