D: <br>  
"Heart sanctified in Death's dark vally. <br>  
Morter'd and brick-ed souls reach towards the sky, <br>  
Or cross the way to those in the allies: <br>  
'Remember me, what life has rent awry!'

Now closed my ears to onanism's shouts, <br>  
And beeping horns who wish to have their way, <br>  
And tweakers who wish me to be without <br>  
My head, so with my torso they could lay. 

They chose to travel here! They chose to be <br>  
That what the Lord despise. They chose to want <br>  
their lives spent in materiality; <br>  
They willed their hearts to be rolled in a blunt 

And smoked in Central Park right by The Rat: <br>  
The Battery lives but The Bronx is splat!"

V: <br>  
"All right, friend, we're both poets here—— <br>  
verse begins to wane as tires the composer. <br>  
Let us please, for once, speak plainly and frankly. <br>  
Before my query, a justification, <br>  
Or, 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APOLOGY: <br>  

&nbsp;

What we have seen in the last twenty four hours—— <br>  
I can tell—— <br>  
Has iced your soul. 

Twenty three ago, you fainted. <br>  
Now, you tread the faces of the suffering <br>  
And deceive them with your words. 

Your God comissioned himself a work <br>  
Out of despicable Florence <br>  
*and* the wood nearby—— <br>  
Lest you forget what brought you thence in the first order. 

Where you not there, in the saddle, at Compaldino? <br>  
Did you *truly* break the font in San Giovanni? <br>  
(You're about one thousand years too late on that one)...

But, friend, <br>  
I love you. <br>  
That's why I carried you. 

And, <br>  
Knowing all this about you, <br>  
Let's put it all aside. <br>  
And, <br>  
Please forgive my cynicality. <br>  
And, <br>  
I promise to answer to you how so many souls could be condemned for revolt against the pagan Jupiter <br>  
If, <br>  
You tell me but this:

Who is this woman who called on me, <br>  
And why does she find such favor?"

D: <br>  
"She was the fire on my heart; <br>  
She was the center of my universe. 

I *did* meet her, when I was very young——and several hours was all it took <br>  
To bring me before those beasts and through this forsaken chasm this day.

It pains me to relinquish, <br>  
Dear Virgil, <br>  
That there are no troubadours:

You, glorious poet, were of a time when men more closely wore themselves on sleeves.

Could you recall *Symposium*? <br>  
(I never read it).

Yes, there once was a Beatrice, <br>  
There once will be an Elizabeth—— <br>  
But, <br>  
Once Shee, Shee is Deade—— <br>  
Thereafter always Benedict, <br>  
Always Elijah——

And thank your beastly Jove for the verse you *knew* 'twould blossom.
