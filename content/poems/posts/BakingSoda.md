True blessings are those who fall out the sky <br>  
When, laughing, God asks "What did you expect?" <br>  
And offers up no satisfacted Why <br>  
Except that some are victims of neglect. 

And spoiled child I was so I shall be. <br>  
In bigger homes are words lost in the grout, <br>  
In one room holes no tile is to be seen—— <br>  
And Taurus Suns——they cannot go without.

But still, when eye meets eye or hand meets hand <br>  
It all transcends that what it was before—— <br>  
Our words contented within both demands, <br>  
And so I like it when we share one door. 

The dog was sick——the bed was filled with piss, <br>  
And punishment in turn was but a kiss.
