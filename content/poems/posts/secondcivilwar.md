The gears done ground and the <br> 
ground ungears

so that those little wildflowers—— <br>  
the ones that only grow under <br>  
perpetual humming conditions—— <br>  
and the endless mammoned memories dug <br>  
up from the plithy hollowed ground <br>  
sustaining them—— —— <br>  
can go unnoticed. 

One reached the red mantle first <br>  
and woulnd't do of it <br>  
because him and all his knew friends <br>  
that green was the winning mantle color—— <br>  
red <br>  
being the losing color.

And red was the flag that a-flared <br>  
up little moustache and goatee threw <br>  
up when it saw 

yezhoved out of the engraving <br>  
into an unspeakable 

God with no beard at all.

It couldn't of been <br>  
for that matter <br>  
as all the follicles <br>  
even the pubes <br>  
were deep-soiled such that his <br>  
face the only commons in law

enclosed and razed <br>  
then opened. Once glazed 

shut again all jaws

for fear and for shame.

But, no. Wrong. Go read your history: <br>  
y'all need to stop asking why I won't shave all the hair off my body.
