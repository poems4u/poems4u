An empty shell of a former home—— <br>  
When the ornaments were taken away, we discovered they had maliciously been hiding our dead skin and hair, <br>  
Our nails from fingers and toes. <br>  
Shame no one will ever know. 

And they can wipe and sweep, scrub and scrub, <br>  
But there are gaps and eaves that we have snuck within, where they will never ever find us. <br>  
We, amnesiacs hereof, <br>  
Rest in the cruc'ble of love. 

We, holy ash and venerable dust.
