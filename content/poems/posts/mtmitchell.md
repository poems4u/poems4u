I'm more than capable of navigation, <br>  
So I was there at the base—— <br>  
Regarding a conifer carpet of black. 

I pushed down the sign <br>  
And ravaged the accommodations. <br>  

My hands were plunged into the deep earth; <br>  
I crawled, like a wild animal, <br>  
Ascending and casting down <br>  
What debris, <br>  
Panting, vomiting: voracious.

I fell prostrate at the summit <br>  
And felt the wind pass above me. 

The firs craned to see the achievement <br>  
Of a staggered stance. <br>  

I stepped over Elisha; <br>  
I ordered the flies to disperse, 

And once I got to where I could <br>  
See you all, attending to <br>  
Your little dreams, 

It was to no one in particular, <br>  
(Addressé au monde) <br>  
and with no locomotive consideration, <br>  
I hope you realize:

I'll fuck you till you love me.
