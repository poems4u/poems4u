A force <br>  
Which compulses contortions in your face, <br>  
Sends spasms through your body, <br>  
Induces irregular emotional intervals—— <br>  
Music!

Positioned above a chair, <br>  
Beside a tea candle, <br>  
Under which was a table, <br>  
Were two ears—— <br>  
A head sat between them <br>  
And so on. 

Then a old man came out, and the lights dimmed. <br>  
We dove in vibrational pools and swam—— <br>  
Shouts and giggles, respectful frowns and grins—— <br>  
"Boom! Buddlii-a-deet, boom-bum-badum bam!"

A silly sheepish smile towards the laughing couple behind me <br>  
As I went for a(nother) tall Slovenian cab. 

Energy sent into the audience, <br>  
With little remorse and lacking constraint. <br>  
It had its way with me——so obvious <br>  
That where I had felt it, wrinkles remained. 

[They think that if Death saw them there, <br>  
Without the marks of time, <br>  
He'd pass them, oh but they forget <br>  
That little babies die :((]

After the show, <br>  
Because it was clear by the timing of my hollers and spasms that I knew what I was hearing, <br>  
A woman slightly aged for my taste was looking at me with big and unreciprocated eyes <br>  
And asked me what I played—— <br>  
I said Mahjong, games, tricks, pranks, jokes, Mario, house, and mermaids. <br>  

I told her she ought to listen to more Sun Ra——for the sake of her soul.

And when her inebriated twink, <br>  
Who looked like a xerox of a xerox of someone I once knew, <br>  
Came over and touched me on the shoulder <br>  
And asked me what I played <br>  
I said Nothing, Just Listen. 

I quickly went on my way, <br>  
and you'll have to understand <br>  
Sometimes that <br>  
Violent imagery doesn't mean that something is bad or wicked or contemptable. <br>  

What I mean is, <br>  
Never, before being in that room, <br>  
not at Disney World, or mass, or McDonald's, or the beach, <br>  
Had I seen so many smiling eyes.
