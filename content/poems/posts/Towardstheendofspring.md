“Somehow, someway, it all comes alive again, <br>  
From contingency being grows wings to fly, <br>  
Always becoming what it might have been, <br>  
But i get sad when cicadas die. <br>  

Yes, there are millions of them, and they all look the same. <br>  
They’re dumb and can’t see very well. <br>  
They’re loud and can get in the way. <br>  
But oh, if they don’t sound the much needed bell <br>  

That the day of judgement has arrived. <br>  
When we’re all called to step out our graves. <br>  
When sir brother sun has us reaching for that denied <br>  
Desire to which we all must be a slave: <br>  

To live! And they have it too. <br>  
They waited underground unlike me and you <br>  
To see what was promised for 17 years blind. <br>  
Imagine, what do you have in mind <br>  

In terms of what it must be like to emerge <br>  
And at once see it all, to gain wings and go <br>  
Up as high as you can simply to perch <br>  
And sing so loud you don’t even know <br>  
How loud you are <br>  
To those below? <br>  

Near and far <br>  
High and low <br>  

A mile away can you sing! <br>  
Can hear the product of your triumph and work, <br>  
Can hear the living tolls of spring, <br>  
Can hear the alarm, life alert. <br>  

And we were blessed to have the advantage <br>  
That these angels are only benign. <br>  
How, of all, did we manage <br>  
To not have the xylem that they like? <br>  

We can be friends with them, unlike so many others <br>  
Who bite or scratch or sting at us, <br>  
And wouldn’t you be sad if one of your friend’s mothers <br>  
Went out for a stroll and got hit by a bus? <br>  

Alas, they are massacred and hated for it. <br>  
Their corpses litter the ground and the street. <br>  
You confound them with your automobiles and concrete, <br>  
And you all get off on your privilege to ignore it <br>  

Your profit seeking soul refuses to see; <br>  
They sing up there all day for free <br>  

And i lost some trees, and i loved some plants, <br>  
And i loved sometimes to go and dance, <br>  
But we all have those we never gave a chance. <br>  
I, like everyone else, step on the ants.”
