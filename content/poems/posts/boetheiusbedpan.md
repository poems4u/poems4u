He hung the yellow ribbon that he won, <br>  
Same color as my piss when drank ice tea, <br>  
Same color as that star that shines: the sun <br>  
That shines on Hofstra University. 

I sniff my fingers cuz they smell like dick, <br>  
And he the same to have a joke at my <br>  
Desire to sense it all until I'm sick; <br>  
I hope to get my own ribbon in time.

And fuck that pagan statesman who once wrote <br>  
That he would be forgot because he ain't. <br>  
Jim Justice has a ribbon round his throat, <br>  
Cuz he made dead ferns pull all of the weight. 

So "laptop! laptop!" what's produced my head <br>  
When shitter's what I meant——now stripped the bed.
