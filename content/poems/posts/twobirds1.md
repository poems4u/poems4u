*After Su Dongpo and Mao Zedong*

Br'er Sun sits high, <br>  
And sev'ral hundred birds flitting nigh <br>  
Can see all happ'nings below—— <br>  
One went to talk with Crow <br>  
With regards to <br>  
The construction: <br>  
"It's so boring here <br>  
With all this noise! <br>  
And dont you find it queer <br>  

That it lacks all purpose?" <br>  
"But what do you mean?" <br>  
Mr. Crow asked. <br>  
"There's nothing on the surface—— <br>  
Time passed here is worthless!" <br>  
"Your dreams aflush <br>  
With urban lust——" <br>  
(Bird then fixed his mask), <br>  
"You'll not find then <br>   
What isn't present near."
