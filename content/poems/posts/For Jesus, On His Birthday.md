I was 6 years in the desert <br>  
Self-exiled, by my own power. <br>  
All gold once found then became dirt <br>  
Heart-housed demons them they showered. <br>  

There, whencefrom buried to my neck <br>  
Came forth my savior with eyes kind <br>  
Not as knight, me to pull from wreck, <br>  
But sickle-celled black man, lame, blind. <br>  

Snow from his nose poured on my head- <br>  
"My poor child destroyed in his self, <br>  
Foolish to think that you are dead  <br>  
Undying light offers his help." <br>  

Forthwith I felt it, though unseen. <br>  
Augmented in strength, thence I lept <br>  
Towards a star, glorious sheen. <br>  
I stayed grounded, though my feet left <br>  

The sand, to be planted on top. <br>  
The wilted flower of my soul <br>  
Through immense, undeserved love <br>  
It will be prayed, and there it shall grow. <br>  

Water only will come when asked. <br>  
Even in drought, often the plant <br>  
Reaches for growth with its own grasp. <br>  
It then shrinks, without the rain, damned, <br>  

But then is reminded of that <br>  
Undying love which lies in wait <br>  
Though unworthy, He has not spat <br>  
But cried tears of joy, far from hate, <br>  

So that his precious flower may then grow <br>  
Only beseeching that it Him may know. <br>
