N.1 <br>  
If all was light, <br>  
we wouldn't be able to see. <br>  
I will go where I am led <br>  
and through this giving thanks, <br>  
may I be brought into what <br>  
I would always become, <br>  
and may my heart quicken in gladness <br>  
at the thought of doing it again. <br>  
 

N.2 <br>  
If it's true that the two primary emotions are fear and love, <br>  
and that they are mutually exclusive, <br>  
Then maybe FDR did nothing wrong, <br>  
and to be afraid is to let the evil <br>  
of the world enter your heart. <br>  
It would like to make you believe you have <br>  
everything to lose; <br>  
nothing could be further from the truth. <br>  

N.3 <br>  
If, in the end, mediocrity reigns, <br>  
then may I be exceptional or awful. <br>  
If, in the time passing, philosophy <br>  
was spoken through literature, <br>  
then may I live a life of art <br>  
with no writing or speaking. <br>
