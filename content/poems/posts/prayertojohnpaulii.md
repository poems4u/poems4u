Pope Saint John Paul II, <br>  
Vicar of Our Lord on Earth for 27 years, <br>  
We look to your guidance and <br>  
Rely on your intercession to help us <br>  
Navigate this wretched physical thing, 

May we, too, <br>  
Benefit from malfeasance, corruption, and assassination. 

May we, too, <br>  
Lie and omit on behalf of associates <br>  
And ourselves <br>  
To save face and reputation, <br>  
Thus influence. 

May we, too, <br>  
Use whatever financial and spiritual power <br>  
To bring down governments, <br>  
Fund mercenaries, <br>  
And create political crises. 

You remind us of the cost of will, <br>  
Of operation: <br>  
Pray for us.

You showed the truth that disabuses the myth of Absolute Power: <br>  
Pray for us.

You rest in heaven because you sullied your hands <br>  
For the sake of Our Lord: <br>  
Pray for us. 

May we keep and remember——<br>  
There is always a cost; <br>  
We are bound by the decisions of those that came before us. 

And, reposed Holy Father, <br>  
May we feel <br>  
Of a certain Gnostic truth: <br>  
As Francis said: "he came from a closed world... 

He was great; <br>  
He was great."
