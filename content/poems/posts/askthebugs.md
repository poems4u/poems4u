They Said: 

"Well, we've been speaking with the moon. <br>  
She told us to ask you a question—— <br>  
He wants to know if you're coming home soon. <br>  
Additionally, we have a suggestion—— <br>  

She'd like to show you something you've never seen before. <br>  
She's in her spot and has meticulously marked and set the stage—— <br>  
Hark! Hence draws desirous drippings; she adds without rancour <br>  
That you _already_ know who burnt down the house with sage."

Thus, on her in the clearing I fixed my attention, <br>  
And all my paranoia withdrew in abstention. 

And I remembered the homily by Fr. Edward Burch, <br>  
Who, one Thursday afternoon, said to the Church 

That anytime he asked God would take him to Fátima. <br>  
And like the aliens took Black Herman away to Africa 

I was thence whisked yonder from out the grove—— <br>  
Goodbye, dark night! <br>  
Goodbye, greasied stove! <br>   
Goodbye, stars! <br>   
Goodbye, bugs! <br>  
Goodbye, cows! <br>  
Goodbye, halves of hugs <br>  
And half a house! <br>  

 
I landed then far undergound inside The Cave, <br>  
Where Diotima twerked on Socrates——dubious rave.
