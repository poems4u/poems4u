This <br>  
for the and not for me:

He locked up all the doors and tore <br>  
out his eys and tongue. 

Stick fire up on in his nose <br>  
and made sure to blow out his hears 

yeah that's what that was yeaah <br>  
we all had to ear it.

Of course, the tactile was on issue <br>  
so he got me to cut out his spinal cord.

No, i'm not sure if it worked <br>  
knows he can't tell me, Lord. 

yeah, You can try. <br>  
We'll bust on up in there and You can <br>  
can gone and give eem a kick square <br>  
in the back of the head <br>  
and see what answers if 
Thisness is left.

He was worried bout the now, yeah <br>  
but he wouldn't let me touch on him brain.

I think he was hoping it would just follow 

like when You cut off one hinge <br>  
and the whole thing falls——

I think it's really stupid idea.
