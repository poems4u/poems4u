The cries of them so deaf'ning none can hear. <br>  
The pile of unknown souls grows year by year, <br>  
The groans in our walls——our treats and coffee, <br>  
Then our naive hope (theirs too was lofty)

Forgets the felt of those on whom we walk, <br>  
Them of whom built the building where we talk <br>  
Of "concrete things" when with haints we cuddle—— <br>  
Death to those who died in pointless struggle. 

Only some can say what all can smell: <br>  
The burning flesh and screams of hell, <br>  
There from there again it go: <br>  
Down down down down below. 

From longlost source 'twas made a rule <br>  
That men in this life must be cruel <br>  
Red ocean blood for eyes that sea—— <br>  
What difference does it make to me?
