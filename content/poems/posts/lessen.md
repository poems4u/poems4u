When, with my plate at table I recline, <br>  
To fill, therewith, that flesh-ed hungry gorge, <br>  
Away from putrid slurry are mine eyes, <br>  
And shut are ears to cheers from smiths at forge. 

Oh! Curse our peepers, who, so wont to fly, <br>  
Protest therein that what is needed most! <br>  
Indignantly, our hearts prefer the sky <br>  
To wretched meek: the feet, bound down below.

Look here! Be chastised one who ne'er desired <br>  
To claim the bed lest 'someone' made him tired!
