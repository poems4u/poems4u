It's recognizable—— <br>  
The hole in my palm <br>  
Is sizeable: <br>  
A coconut un-songed <br>  
Sleeps hidden in hay, <br>  
And cock crows the way 

Yet obscured by snow—— <br>  
Thus, it can be recalled <br>  
Before you even know <br>  
That paint dries off the wall: <br>  
Former figure now hidden away; <br>  
The workers choke their working day.

Would that he could reveal <br>  
The oustide's in. <br>  
Could that he would make real <br>  
The inside's win, <br>  
Make prodigal those parts gone astray <br>  
And bring back hither not but to say: 

"Remember, when we first met, <br>  
How young and delicate I was? <br>  
You stifled my gaze, but my heart not yet <br>  
Free still sings and dances because <br>  
I *can't* just visit, so I plan to stay. <br>  
I'm going to go back there some day."
