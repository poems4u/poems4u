When put on Earth, received all their own Job: <br>  
So Elihu, with lies disguised as truths, <br>  
Whose "I am" bears cogito of Magog, <br>  
Will come to those whose faith bears rotten fruit. 

I saw one _Enallagma Basidens_, <br>  
Who, gliding low on surface glassied creek, <br>  
Would then consent his clasp to go within, <br>  
Thereafter she was drowned: submerg-ed stick.

It's such a shame that we will never know <br>  
Who said one night beneath the Palace roof: <br>  
"When Sun comes out, him rising from below, <br>  
His sister Lilith hides not her dark moon."

Gestated fear, when brought to term, won't bend, <br>  
Though he desires his self to be concrete, <br>  
For that which he abhorred becomes the end, <br>  
As doorstep demons get two kisses sweet.
