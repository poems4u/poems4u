For free, handing out poems on the street, <br>  
E'en the reading man disliked my stuff: <br>  

"When all is black it's y'all who lack sight's ability, <br>  
For nothing has no hues, like sterility." <br>  

He suggested a medium treat <br>  
Meant of all that which I love. <br>  

The musician who in underemployment wallows, <br>  
Reveals his enjoyment such as follows: <br>  

Beauty, though whole, is expressed in privational difference, <br>  
So I love all poems, even libational limericks. <br>  
Beauty's true identity is metaphysical music, <br>  
So I love communication absent language, flesh lucid. <br>  
Even film, writing, fashion–beauty in sounds and images <br>  
Are music too when their power isn't viewed as limited. <br>  
So I love art, especially the finest work of them all– <br>  
The world! God's gift to himself, wherefrom the clench of evil's jaw <br>  
Was birthed. Without it we could see no good. Made separate from God, <br>  
We only see beauty limited. We (not Him) have a job. <br>  
We of two natures, being and not, have choice of life or death. <br>  
Most choose the latter, scared of what crouches in between breaths, <br>  
But this is foolish. When death dies life goes back to where it's from. <br>  
If life and death are love and fear, it's clear to know which to want. <br>  
So I'll tell you what love to love, it starts within the body– <br>  
Walking, dancing, shouting; muscles aching and noses snotty; <br>  
When the heart beats so fast that it is felt inside of the head, <br>  
Or the calm serenity of limbs working to make a bed; <br>  
Tripping and falling and breaking the skin while playing a sport, <br>  
Or granting legs mobility by in summer wearing shorts. <br>  
Whether cooking or eating, in pleasantries or pain, know this: <br>  
Inside all the sensations of the body is where love is. <br>  
Next comes language–mindless nonsense as the philosopher knows. <br>  
Into the heart and not the brain do spoken and written word go. <br>  
Schizophrenically, sounds are thought to have a concrete meaning; <br>  
Really, they lie prostrate before us as a mirror gleaming. <br>  
What is intimated to others as hateful derision <br>  
Can bring joy to another listener; it's their decision. <br>  
"My left toe respires as watches the wall friend Mary Sue," <br>  
Could drive one to suicide, to another is "I love you." <br>  
So hear as you wish. Speak from the stomach. Remain undaunted. <br>  
If love is in each word, evil loses his rhodomontade. <br>  
Whereof nature–plants and animals and flying and creeping things, <br>  
Mountains and valleys, the ocean and creeks? All together sing. <br>  
The sting of a wasp can be read as a novel encounter. <br>  
Flies can be released from your house without death or disaster. <br>  
Trees rustling and creaking in the wind is a song made by two, <br>  
And if he caves in your roof be glad that nature has touched you. <br>  
The sun beating down on a crow which makes him scream and holler <br>  
Also drives you to the store, buying beer with your last dollar. <br>  
And I hope you didn't think that we were outside of nature.<br>  
There's no demarcation between those whose lack the same crater, <br>  
For we all spend our days extracting desires from planet Earth. <br>  
Even the machines are singing, because they know well their worth. <br>  
Have you ever heard of "Landslide?" It's a song by Fleetwood Mac; <br>  
It's a cover of the same song rocks play thrust down mountains' backs. <br>  
You have permission to love violence, for it resides in us all. <br>  
There is no good and evil, right and wrong; there is only law. <br>  
When God made the world He put no evil in it, just difference. <br>  
Fullness is forbidden in this life–don't you try to spin it <br>  
Into some nasty narrative about getting all that you want. <br>  
Pain is the cost of enforcing distinguishment. Being blunt, <br>  
There is no purpose to feeling despair–everything is art, <br>  
Which is really the first link in the chain, acting as a start <br>  
From art, which is beauty, which is music, which, indeed, is love, <br>  
Which is life, which is being, which is our God above. <br>  
But there is that which I love most of all: those poor in spirit. <br>  
Who read and saw the Word but never had the chance to hear it. <br>  
Those hurt, taken from, found in circumstances unrequested. <br>  
Those on whom violence has a toll but go on unmolested. <br>  
They will inherit all the knowledge to see that which is love, <br>  
Which is the Earth, which is God, who is the stars, which is enough.
