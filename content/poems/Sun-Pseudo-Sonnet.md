She prefers the pool while does lapse my mind <br>  
Engaged in research of Sir Brother Sun. <br>  
Does he wake each dawn indignant or kind? <br>  
If the day is dubious, the knight won. <br>  

For he does shine and does irradiate <br>  
A crow and dog sharing some fentanyl <br>  
With a man a hard earned meal served on plate <br>  
Stars or shine morality rendered null <br>  

As all that gives indifferently destroys. <br>  
Swarming gnats want to know if you can hear <br>  
Straining echoes of the last dying voice <br>  
Or tell their dreams from a castrated leer. <br>  

King of the Mountain for a morn still shows <br>  
Holes in the heart where all the mercy goes. <br>
