I wish it were easier to become dead <br>  
I'm only halfway there <br>  
I feel in time and space <br>  
but not completely <br>  
As if at risk for flying away <br>  
were I not held by a string <br>  

But the wind still blows this way and <br>  
that Mother Mary please prays for me <br>  
Or fixes me with a stake <br>  
to one thing <br>  
forever <br>
