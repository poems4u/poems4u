As I lay me down to sleep <br>  
None could keep mine eyes from weep <br>  
Except one small, distant hope <br>  
Which saves me from that self-inflicted rope <br>  

Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day <br>  
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away <br>  

So with a start I prattle about my miserable and wretched hovel <br>  
Strewn here and there, chairs and tables overturned, hurrying to find that shovel <br>  
With which I march to Juno for to dredge him abreast <br>  
The man with whom I'll walk before the throne, damned the rest <br>  


Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day <br>  
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away <br>  

On that climb I'll gaze with him upon the throng-ed score <br>  
And our weeping for them will be the sweeping river which them keeps from the ajar-ed door <br>  
Our boundless pity will be that which plunges the vast multitude down below <br>  
On my knees for it the Lord I'll beg for mercy, that what I did not know <br>  

Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day <br>  
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away <br>  

But wait! The throne is vacate <br>  
And the seemingly evicted masses now there, impossible to placate <br>  
There, at the empty chair of God, an ongoing competition of jumping and screaming <br>  
We search around in vain for our Lord, hearts bereaving <br>  

Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day <br>  
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away <br>  

Suddenly, a trap door swings open at my feet, my poor companion left behind <br>  
"The pulp so bitter; How shall taste the rind?" <br>  
Down I'm cast, into a room far below, where stands only she <br>  
Her gaze betrays for whom she sought was not me <br>  

Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day <br>  
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away <br>  

But my beloved Holy Mother still greets me with a warm-hearted sigh <br>  
Her other Son (the important One) sleeps elsewhere, we knowest not where He lie <br>  
She who wanted a different man and me a different woman... Alas, look! <br>  
As she reaches for the record of my life, that despicable book <br>  
A tear then rolls from her eye, and she begins to speak: <br>  
"I long with peirced heart to forgive you, but, oh, I am so weak <br>  
Only my Son can do that, and written here your pride betrays you." <br>  
That last unpurgable desire still plagues my soul: ten thousand years I'll go through <br>  
The heat begins surrounded, her crossing me the last vision to greet my eye <br>  
Before I forthwith started awake in my bed with a cry: <br>  

"Thank God! Thank God tomorrow shan't be the day <br>  
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away!" <br>
