Out of love and out of time, <br>  
It's true the last year ought've plagued my mind, <br>  
But I still feel the need to look inside <br>  
A live mind <br>  
To find what live there is inside after it already died. <br>  

Indeed, there were some wheels and satellites still spinning, <br>  
Even as it looked little little like it did before. <br>  
Whatever game you've gleaned to be losing or winning, <br>  
You'll find that you you once were is there no more. <br>  

And no matter how bad we'd like to break this pattern, <br>  
Can't nothing bring Sun Ra on back from Saturn. <br>  
Even if the reaper does come for ol' Testicular Torsion Tim, <br>  
Whose left necrotic nut would be generously given to him, <br>  

He will never return to Planet Earth, <br>  
Will never accept entropic loss as sufficient sacrifice, <br>  
Will never take trash to show us our worth. <br>  
Still, it's nice to recognize <br>  

That God is in that piece of trash, too, <br>  
As are all the bits of old me and older you. <br>  
As a result, I cannot suppress the shame <br>  
Of an instance when last Monday a click beetle walked through our door frame. <br>  

I was called on and told a demon came in for dinner, <br>  
Despite the holy water. <br>  
Two grown men hollering hither <br>  
To see a brown bug so big it could've been Kronos's Father. <br>  

Quoth, "scared and unprepared," the presumed roach <br>  
Was to be sent forth from his hiding, the knave, <br>  
And chased out the front door. Our space he'd not encroach <br>  
All so that his disgusting and unworthy life might be saved. <br>  

But I played too fast and too loose. <br>  
On his head fell the rack of shoes. <br>  
Still, he limped his way out the front door <br>  
all while furiously clicking: "Nevermore!" <br>  


By opening his mouth to speak he revealed himself <br>  
Not a roach. <br>  
And I felt my mind clarified <br>  
To imagine him terrified; <br>  
I felt gross. <br>  
Me, with my contingent consciousness and mystical wealth <br>  

Somehow believed I was more entitled than him. <br>  
I saw it! I risked his life on whim. <br>  

And if a tree really feels no trauma <br>  
Then whereof all this drama <br>  
Of Uprooting the earth? An Aristotelian attempt at going home <br>  
Fails devastatingly. At best his time on Earth reduced to loam <br>  

As will befall all of us, <br>  
Ash to ash and dust to dust. <br>  

It's funny in the same way with women and men, <br>  
Who massacre and slaughter to keep pink or keep red <br>  
When they're really just a touch of white apart, <br>  
As with race and with art. <br>  

All this and I still despair <br>  
At my destiny of waking up as my high school band director and living his life: <br>  
Fat and fundamentalist, no potential to have ever been squandered, no friends and no hair <br>  
With melted children and mennonite wife. <br>  

So it's hard to be optimistic, to know what's real and what's not <br>  
When on the first day of June it doesn't smell like it should in the foothills of the Appalachian Piedmont. <br>  
Still, if you were to ask me whether I'd rather keep my testicle sinister or those that left last July, <br>  
In a poem I cannot write a lie. <br>
