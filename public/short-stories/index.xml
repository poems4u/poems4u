      <description>After Tolstoy 1&#xA;“When my bird was looking at my computer monitor, I thought ‘wooooah, that bird has no idea what he’s looking at.’ And yet, what does the bird do? Does he panic? No, he can’t really panic, he just does the best he can. Is he able to live in a world where he’s so ignorant? Well, he doesn’t really have a choice. Yeah, he can kinda live… usually the bird’s okay, even though he doesn’t understand the world, and he can kinda learn what’s safe and what’s dangerous.</description>
