<p>When I first saw the two blue Maos I felt as if the one leaning forward was mean and the one reclining was nice. Looking again, my interpretation has changed. The soft features of the forward-leaning Mao, in tandem with the squiggles on either side of his shoulder, invoking balance, and whatever color work has been done on his eyebrows, giving them a softer and even partially raised feel, makes him appear as a slightly concerned friend. On the other hand, the sharpness of the reclining Mao (indeed, it does seem as if a portion of the left side of his face has been covered by the blue of the background), his thicker eyebrows, and relatively accentuated wrinkles cast judgement. He leans into the squiggles on his right side, almost as if they whisper malfeasance.</p>
