    <h1>Dante and Virgil Talk Along The Speculated « River » Lethe (Canto 1 : 2)</h1>

    

    <p>D: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&ldquo;Heart sanctified in Death&rsquo;s dark vally, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Morter&rsquo;d and brick-ed souls reach towards the sky <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Or cross the way to those in the allies: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lsquo;Remember me, what life has rent ary!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now closed my ears to onanism&rsquo;s shouts, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And beeping horns who wish to have their way, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And tweakers who wish me to be without <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
My head, so with my torso they could lay.</p>
<p>They chose to travel here! They chose to be <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That what the Lord despise. They chose to want <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
their lives spent in materiality; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
They willed their hearts to be rolled in a blunt</p>
<p>And smoked in Central Park right by The Rat: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The Battery lives but The Bronx is splat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>V: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
All right, friend, we&rsquo;re both poets here——verse begins to wane as tires the composer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Let us please, for once, be speak plainly and frankly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Before my query, a justification, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Or,</p>
<p>                       APOLOGY:
What we have seen in the last twenty four hours—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I can tell—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Has iced your soul.</p>
<p>Twenty three ago, you fainted. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Now, you tread the faces of the suffering <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And deceive them with your words.</p>
<p>Your God comissioned himself a work <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Out of despicable Florence <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>and</em> the wood nearby—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Lest you forget what brought you there in the first place.</p>
<p>Where you not there, in the saddle, at Compaldino? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Did you <em>truly</em> break the font in San Giovanni? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
(You&rsquo;re about one thousand years too late on that one)&hellip;</p>
<p>But, friend, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I love you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That&rsquo;s why I carried you.</p>
<p>And, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Knowing all this about you, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Let&rsquo;s put it all aside. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Please forgive my cynicality. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I promise to answer to you how so many souls could be condemned for revolt against the pagan Jupiter <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
If, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
You tell me but this:</p>
<p>Who is this woman who called on me, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And why does she find such favor?&quot;</p>
<p>D:
&ldquo;She was the fire on my heart; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
She was the center of my universe.</p>
<p>I <em>did</em> meet her, when I was very young——and several hours was all it took <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To bring me before those beasts and through this forsaken chasm this day.</p>
<p>It pains me to relinquish, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Dear Virgil, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That there are no trabadours:</p>
<p>You, glorious poet, were of a time when men more closely wore themselves on sleeves.</p>
<p>Could you recall <em>Symposium</em>? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
(I never read it).</p>
<p>Yes, there once was a Beatrice, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
There once will be an Elizabeth—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Once Shee, Shee is Deade—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Thereafter always Benedict, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Always Elijah——</p>
<p>And thank your beastly Jove for the verse you <em>knew</em> &rsquo;twould blossom.</p>
