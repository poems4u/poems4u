<p>And there, in the dementia tic years
of the 19th century
The faintest natal nascence of
the second kingdom was born
in the middle of the middle.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Poor Hong Xiuquan smiled
in his tomb
(of which there was none.
More like ashes
Dispirate, stirring).
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> God is funny like that,
to send his direct message through failure
to beget another,
indeed more confused,
and yet,
in contradiction, closer to enacting the truth.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Who are the &ldquo;Jews&rdquo; anyway?
Just by reading the newspapers
I can tell you who is chosen.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps 1966 was closer to 0
than anything else.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> And 2050 will be like 33.
Whencefrom already mists the yakubian acid rain.
And the white devils are so myopically focused
on trading one umbrella for another,
they can&rsquo;t even see the distant red star.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Admittedly faint, it shines brighter now
than did 100 years ago.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The way to know?<br>
The learned astronomer can&rsquo;t
(won&rsquo;t?) see it.
Even if one were to frantically search
through the peer reviewed,
one wouldn&rsquo;t find it.
Neither would I, though I do know where to look.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Rather, I feel it,
as Christ&rsquo;s radiant smile.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> And so I leave the dome for
the lecture hall,
snickering</p>
