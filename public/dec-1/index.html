    <h1 id="dec-1">Dec. 1</h1>
<p>Like the creek happens to run with automobile traffic
(Though they are at best enemies)
so too, if you find yourself amongst the 7 foilaged trees
in the heart of winter,
likely without your rosary ,
The Beam comes around the bend
And the tic turns your head
To meet its gaze feeling as steam
Screaming, you&rsquo;ll kneel.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> eventually, prostrate,
Ants will crawl up your nose
And the orchestra will appear
held there, supplicant
They&rsquo;ll play
and you will cry,
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> And as the intermission starts,
while the conductor and the concert master
shake hands, smiling towards
a thunderous applause
with no eyes,
a car will fly off of
Fordham Blvd.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Many in the ensemble will be flattened
And you will sink through the floor
left will only sonerous memories,
To be met at the desk of Hell
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> You&rsquo;ll get checked in
(Wow! Ninth Circle!)
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> once you&rsquo;re up to your neck
and a few weeks pass,
a hole will open in the ceiling
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It&rsquo;s Jesus
accompanied with the ringing of hundreds of millions
of telephones,
and his eyes will tell you
he&rsquo;ll be back soon
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> He&rsquo;ll drop you down a pair of skates
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Beelzebub and Yaldaboath
will jump for them
but be blasted back.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Your naked body will be freed
and you&rsquo;ll skate-in-wait
as the icy wind blows,
and your teeth will chatter
with a smile</p>
