<p>N.1
If all was light,
we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see.
I will go where I am led
and through this giving thanks,
may I be brought into what
I would always become,
and may my heart quicken in gladness
at the thought of doing it again.

N.2
If it&rsquo;s true that the two primary emotions are fear and love,
and that they are mutually exclusive,
Then maybe FDR did nothing wrong,
and to be afraid is to let the evil
of the world enter your heart.
It would like to make you believe you have
everything to lose;
nothing could be further from the truth.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
N.3
If, in the end, mediocrity reigns,
then may I be exceptional or awful.
If, in the time passing, philosophy
was spake through literature,
then may I live a life of art
with no writing or speaking.</p>
