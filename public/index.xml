      <description>Well&amp;hellip;. I- I have a diagnosis, you know.&#xA;It means there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with me&amp;hellip; but they don&amp;rsquo;t know what.&#xA;I imagine it&amp;rsquo;s very hard for them, trying to figure that for a time or so, every now and then.&#xA;I have a body and other physical characteristics, but I suppose that isn&amp;rsquo;t what you mean.&#xA;I mean, that hasn&amp;rsquo;t really got anything to do with ME, does it?&#xA;Sure, I have feelings, even beliefs, but they only come in for dinner or supper, even tea, I&amp;rsquo;d say, Then they go merrily on their way.</description>

      <description>It was 10:15 AM, Sunday,&#xA;And you stood and trembled for an hour and a half.&#xA;I, with four hours of sleep, particularly susceptible to the energy of the moment,&#xA;Saw your glasses falling As you looked into the Book And immediately grew afraid.</description>

      <description>Though lack——indeed——inserted there We still could find our way. The preparation strectching show Would not be won that day.&#xA;But my tripartite spirit likes All touching and caress, And if the motion felt so good, My astral left this mess.&#xA;Two bodies thus transcend their realm—— It sent me through the stars. The Texans tried but could not stop Two rocketships to Mars!&#xA;And please forgive my thinly veiled Perverted enchanté.</description>

      <description>The humidity permitted The universal dispersal of the static shock Abound in the 80 degree November. It lept from one drop to another, It filled every hole, swallowed every surface, Until, at last, it burrowed its way into the secret of the switch, And the machine was designated &amp;ldquo;On.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Whence did commence the spinning wheels—— Manufactory for the armies of fingers To group To circumscribe To collapse In searching for bits and pieces emerging from identified individuals: In Search of Unification within Formal Guilt.</description>

      <description>AUDIO&#xA;Three of us in the tub On the side of the stage.&#xA;The pastor, my father, a drowned wolf spider, and I, Who, with wandering eye,&#xA;Did declare&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Im sorry you drowned, man.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh, no, It&amp;rsquo;s quite alright! See, I did this on purpose. I grew lost in these immense halls, where reside few flies or other crawling/flying pests. I&amp;rsquo;ve become weak and weary. Endeavored and convicted I had adhered well to His plan for me, I drowned myself in this holy water, so that I may too join in beatitude and sing of all creation and substance.</description>

      <description>Call did the Major Briggs For all the able bodied men. He called them to kneel——to dig. While cedars trembled in the wind&#xA;They sailed their way to Beacon Mound To render convex their earthen hole—— Built a hollow cone forth the ground And desired the Union to lull Over the rocky shoals and shallows. Savages aground, they&amp;rsquo;d show themselves, numbered sixty——&#xA;Would defend their island home hallowed And slaughter all the enemy.</description>

      <description>Ensouled Encaged Rotting and heavy—— In every instance an immense aching for rest And Settlement.&#xA;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dream of singing. Rather, I should be a leaf in the (How long will the [Wind.] blow?)&#xA;Or should like to burrow or claw a way from out my skin And fly away to the moon Or even yonder and on, Up where the eye knows but cannot see, Where the assemblage of rocks and minerals, Which we call inhabitance, Would only will to oblige And collapse:</description>

He went away from me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In the aftermath of the embrace—— In the broadening of the seperation between the one going Coming Down And the One remaining in that place away from places—— The increasing distance between two hearts Is not negative, Empty,&#xA;But rather is filled with that expansion of love Which pours out from the cracks in amphorous memory-vessels.</description>

      <description>AUDIO&#xA;&amp;ldquo;May it please the court, and may I first present That Mrs. Babbitt came to The Bay with God&amp;rsquo;s assent. In Trump&amp;rsquo;s America, it was allowed That Mr. Babbitt be seen as well-endowed (Monitarily, of course), and though she was worthless Was proud to be named Queen of The Pool Service. And when the feds called the loan, she was too retarded To make any sense of it, she started With the Pizzagate and the cabal, And the homeless, immigrants——the wall That she climbed——in her pocket a knife, And for the brief moment &amp;lsquo;fore the end of her life She got to feel in charge of her fate; A creature so useless been forced to wait for any sense of agency, Judge, and Michael, y&amp;rsquo;all know me, How I was appointed by Him to know The faults and fallings of the masses below.</description>

      <description>The cries of them so deaf&amp;rsquo;ning none can hear. The pile of unknown souls grows year by year, The groans in our walls——our treats and coffee, Then our naive hope (theirs too was lofty)&#xA;Forgets the felt of those on whom we walk, Them of whom built the building where we talk Of &amp;ldquo;concrete things&amp;rdquo; when with haints we cuddle—— Death to those who died in pointless struggle.&#xA;Only some can say what all can smell: The burning flesh and screams of hell, There from there again it go: Down down down down below.</description>

      <description>To Whom the Poems R 4,&#xA;Firstly, a big thank you to anybody reading. I hope y’all have enjoyed some of the poems; I am always available at my email for thoughts. THE SOLAR-MYTH APPROACH has been taking me to new places recently, places where words mean what they don’t. Please read with an open mind.&#xA;Secondly, a new article is in the works. It is a VULTURES retrospective. I have no planned date for when it will release——expect it to be around 20000 words.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I was the first to have heard. I published the newspapers on that day. I was the one they deigned absurd, But when the sea parted, who else made way? No one else discovered the third In King David&amp;rsquo;s little psalms. None else flew——two-winged bird—— While they hid faces in palms. When each one in their cowardice deferred, Only I dared speak the truth, When, as with age, the wisdom was transferred, &amp;lsquo;Twas I who occupied the youth.</description>

And dont you find it queer That it lacks all purpose?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;But what do you mean?&amp;rdquo; Mr. Crow asked. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing on the surface—— Time passed here is worthless!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Your dreams aflush With urban lust——&amp;rdquo; (Bird then fixed his mask), &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll not find then What isn&amp;rsquo;t present near.</description>

      <description>True blessings are those who fall out the sky When, laughing, God asks &amp;ldquo;What did you expect?&amp;rdquo; And offers up no satisfacted Why Except that some are victims of neglect.&#xA;And spoiled child I was so I shall be. In bigger homes are words lost in the grout, In one room holes no tile is to be seen—— And Taurus Suns——they cannot go without.&#xA;But still, when eye meets eye or hand meets hand It all transcends that what it was before—— Our words contented within both demands, And so I like it when we share one door.</description>

Tell me the news!&amp;rdquo; (And sorry to the Mexican who shared my needles, Cuz HIV is coming soon).</description>

      <description>Somehow, the mullet breached the sea wall To terrorize the neighborhood with their squelching—— Constantly sucking debris into their maws, And the endemic AC hum isn&amp;rsquo;t helping. Another night sat illicitly, As the school sought to swallow One half of symmetry. Reflected on the lake within the hollow&#xA;Was a brightly lit home partitioned by palm. Subtle piano notes sounded about the air, But those frenzied fish disquited the calm—— A thought was inserted: it wasn&amp;rsquo;t fair That nobody told Narcissus That what he saw was something other.</description>

So we sat with wet hair on the misty roof Looking for beautiful horses, looking for proof.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rdquo; knew nothing, but eye had all veracity Of liking this boy who emerged from his mouse hole to walk in the rain; He was tender and sweet, complete with the sagacity Of a serial killer——he showed me his collection of frozen brains.</description>

      <description>Lord, in your wisdom you made the rain—— So often a necessary inconvenience; You decided to make the reign (Of A. Spirit, that is) So often a necessary inconvenience.&#xA;You included mosquitoes and cockroaches in your plan. You set the heavenly bodies in motion—— At times agreeing, At times disagreeing.&#xA;My God, you created every living and &amp;ldquo;non-living&amp;rdquo; thing with purpose; In our iniquity and ignorance before you we are worthless.</description>

Shame no one will ever know.&#xA;And they can wipe and sweep, scrub and scrub, But there are gaps and eaves that we have snuck within, where they will never ever find us. We, amnesiacs hereof, Rest in the cruc&amp;rsquo;ble of love.</description>

      <description>A diverted interlude, Sheltered in the covet Of a slanted tree, Which ran up to my ankles.&#xA;Actually, it was two. One which covered half,&#xA;And the other, Which grew almost parallel To the flowing glass, Before curving up from the bank.&#xA;He then sloped down and Placed a foot on the riverbed, Completing the aforementioned—— Covet in pavilion style.&#xA;And if one were to grow Brave and step Out from the denier Of the Sun&amp;rsquo;s patterns Into the carcinogenic light,</description>

      <description>A force Which compulses contortions in your face, Sends spasms through your body, Induces irregular emotional intervals—— Music!&#xA;Positioned above a chair, Beside a tea candle, Under which was a table, Were two ears—— A head sat between them And so on.&#xA;Then a old man came out, and the lights dimmed. We dove in vibrational pools and swam—— Shouts and giggles, respectful frowns and grins—— &amp;ldquo;Boom! Buddlii-a-deet, boom-bum-badum bam!&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s after the end of the world, don&amp;rsquo;t you know that yet?&#xA;Since 33, most have believed the Apocalypse would come in their lifetime. It&amp;rsquo;s probably because when something ends, it is then finished, And finished things will no longer produce novelty. Admittedly, most of this Planet&amp;rsquo;s novelty is bleak—— How often immense hope is co-opted by the forces of fear To end in failure. So too History must end, But it came before thyme and after singing; In this life it ain&amp;rsquo;t no Burger Kinging—— When Ol&amp;rsquo; John P had his way, the truth we did forget.</description>

Indeed as were his architecture plans To conjure more flimsy wire and concrete,&#xA;Revealed to me by Trojan and Greek hands, Flanking our Jupiter ninety degrees On both sides. On hexagonal shaped streets&#xA;Stood I&#xA;On Saturn,&#xA;Whose ouroboros rail it wounds round and round; Janus reports on the unseen and Knot ,Which, tied at the planet core, Holds fast us to its revolutions qua time.</description>

For he does shine and does irradiate A crow and dog sharing some fentanyl With a man a hard earned meal served on plate Stars or shine morality rendered null As all that gives indifferently destroys. Swarming gnats want to know if you can hear Straining echoes of the last dying voice Or tell their dreams from a castrated leer.</description>

      <description>One realizes when they go out west. That so many have never seen a real southern belle twink before. A prophet is never recognized is his own home, at best, And so i like to see things I’ve never seen before. The south is so provincial in ways we often forget. Here, it’s a phone booth every couple blocks, most neighborhoods have a community garden, Sundry others which beget, Freedom, but somehow, with such amenities, hearts harden.</description>

      <description>Out of love and out of time, It&amp;rsquo;s true the last year ought&amp;rsquo;ve plagued my mind, But I still feel the need to look inside A live mind To find what live there is inside after it already died. Indeed, there were some wheels and satellites still spinning, Even as it looked little like it did before. Whatever game you&amp;rsquo;ve gleaned to be losing or winning, You&amp;rsquo;ll find that you you once were is there no more.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The pulse returns for prodigal suns Who hid themselves in the deep covet of a darkened cloud, Refusing rejoinder for those things thought out loud. And they were cached there of their own selfish wants When four little children began drowning at once. They went untried for their crimes &amp;ndash; no one saw them Because rays of light found four bodies at the bottom. And no matter the memories of the secrets stashed there sliced and sewn up, Because the body, Every time, Forgets out of pure frustration At its sensations Anesthetized, While the digits of demons deposit eggs that when grown up Too remember nothing of the host&amp;rsquo;s consummate constipation.</description>

Yes, there are millions of them, and they all look the same. They’re dumb and can’t see very well. They’re loud and can get in the way. But oh, if they don’t sound the much needed bell That the day of judgement has arrived.</description>

Does he panic? No, he can’t really panic, he just does the best he can. Is he able to live in a world where he’s so ignorant? Well, he doesn’t really have a choice. Yeah, he can kinda live… usually the bird’s okay, even though he doesn’t understand the world, and he can kinda learn what’s safe and what’s dangerous.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s something like losing your leg; So you must learn to walk without it. And it gets to a point where grief is of no use— A one legged man you are. It makes little difference to the truth; Besides, nothing can be done.&#xA;But there are still those nights, Just before sleep, When you hope, Maybe even believe, That the miracle will be you.&#xA;You&amp;rsquo;ll wake with firm foot And run in ecstasy to the kitchen Or the living room Or porch, To holler: &amp;ldquo;Hallelujah!</description>

      <description>When, when he snubbed his nose at me Oh, how I bristled with delight. Nothing but evil could he be who took such pleasure in my plight. It was already known, the thought which bore its way into his mind. Serreptitious there, demon bought Solely for pleasure of its kind. But when the dog steals all the food Or when a child, denied, does cry, &amp;lsquo;Twas by a Spinozistic mode Those barbaric desires fly Into the poor and ill-restrained mechanical animal mind.</description>

      <description>I was 6 years in the desert Self-exiled, by my own power. All gold once found then became dirt Heart-housed demons them they showered. There, whencefrom buried to my neck Came forth my savior with eyes kind Not as knight, me to pull from wreck, But sickle-celled black man, lame, blind. Snow from his nose poured on my head- &amp;ldquo;My poor child destroyed in his self, Foolish to think that you are dead Undying light offers his help.</description>

      <description>I miss that little boy There were days when he cried and screamed But there are days when I do that too And I think he liked me - They were all calling for me to come back I was looking at pictures today They exist like beacons in a haze But the fog is too thick- Nothing is illuminated When was this? Who am I? Your smile is so bright there and I&amp;rsquo;ll never see it again nor remember how it was conjured in the first place To you, I must be a corpse with a death mask- And some wretched animating force moving me- And you were fooled to think this dead alive But perhaps by this power it was- and so it will I dug it all up today- and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry it was a demon in me, or something But even he could grow weary, and I often tucked him in with a glass of warm milk so we could be left alone.</description>

      <description>N.1 If all was light, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to see. I will go where I am led and through this giving thanks, may I be brought into what I would always become, and may my heart quicken in gladness at the thought of doing it again. N.2 If it&amp;rsquo;s true that the two primary emotions are fear and love, and that they are mutually exclusive, Then maybe FDR did nothing wrong, and to be afraid is to let the evil of the world enter your heart.</description>

      <description>A swift flick, swerve Placed us here In this grey-washed atrium watching television on the floor- they gave us nowhere to sit. Even in that moment I felt a strange lilt in my heart.&#xA;Two bulls: dumb, headstrong, naive, smug, stubborn, and born with a recalcitrant need to be known made use of, and loved. Oceans in our eyes and rainforests in our hearts. Besides that, nothing in common. But still, you saw me smile and wheeled or wobbled over to attend to me.</description>

      <description>Like the creek happens to run with automobile traffic (Though they are at best enemies) so too, if you find yourself amongst the 7 foilaged trees in the heart of winter, likely without your rosary, The Beam comes around the bend And the tic turns your head To meet its gaze feeling as steam Screaming, you&amp;rsquo;ll kneel. eventually, prostrate, Ants will crawl up your nose And the orchestra will appear held there, supplicant They&amp;rsquo;ll play and you will cry, And as the intermission starts, while the conductor and the concert master shake hands, smiling towards a thunderous applause with no eyes, a car will fly off of Fordham Blvd.</description>

      <description>He was taken Lifted into the sky And was replaced with a copy The copy looked and sounded like him and kept up the ruse for awhile sweet + tender, delicate like a lily in the cold grew legs and ran to the top of the mountain, and threw itself off tumbled down holes in leaves Flowers left in disarray all behind for the hooves of bulls to later trample as they tried in vain to pick them up with their teeth, Lucky ones digested once he grabbed her by the hair, led her outside to shrieks + hollers a crowd formed Booing and gnashing teeth she was gnashed in turn and so the choir found themselves too gnashed at once all together in inexplicable violence that night they took the copy back and the original was returned with memories formed by the bubbling of Alka-Seltzer in stomach acid And as it bubbled, his hands grew to the size of stones, whence he had to drag forever </description>

      <description>If beauty has one immutible, intersubjective quality, is is transience. Like a lightning bolt from above, it flashes for but an instance in the grand scheme of things, and then it is gone&amp;hellip; On Friday, I passed it in its sublimity. Halted in my tracks as if it were a wall. On Monday, in its place was death, decay, disgust, dread. I covered my mouth and ran just to trip and fall, to lie there, in that salinity, prostrate, for some time.</description>

      <description>The year is 202X, and alien life has finally found its way to Earth. These Alien beings are far more technologically advanced than us humans. In a matter of months, they teach us what would have taken centuries to discover: travel at the speed of light, among other things. These Aliens reproduce sexually, just like us. However, they go about it by means of external fertilization—the female lays her eggs in a location where, later, a male will fertilize them.</description>

And I&amp;rsquo;m left on my back With eyes towards the sky.</description>

      <description>Awoken from slumber and feeling the tension of the moment par coup, I flew to the archives, meticulously kept but thus far unread. These records changed me; One realizes one can&amp;rsquo;t let go of things one has said.&#xA;Forsooth, the voices of the pages have been whispering to my unconscious, And at last question meets answer.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d been using a crutch to stand; One outgrows such things.&#xA;And yet the memories circle me as vultures; I can&amp;rsquo;t run from the easeness of tender voices, heartbeats, gazes.</description>

      <description>Cela s’est passé comme suit :&#xA;« Q. » « Well, I had sleeping problems for a while. The doctor recommended things like Clonazepam, Ambien, &amp;amp;c., but I thought I would much rather have something natural. So, I began to take melatonin supplements. Only 5 milligrams, about 30 minutes before I went to bed. As a matter of course, I now began to have issues awaking in the morning. The doctor said something like Wellbutrin, which I happily and willfully ignored.</description>

      <description>1882: Nietzsche tears through the heavenly veil to find the Body of God, dead for 300 years. The corpse was rotting; maggot demons crawled through all His divine orifices, and the blood from the wound made centuries ago continued to gush forth, invisible to the naked eye, pouring like a monsoon on the realm of the demiurge, drowning all of humanity in ordained monadity.&#xA;C. 50: The remaining druids secretly gather in the Scottish Hills to perform a final ritual.</description>

      <description>Then was reckoning,&#xA;In the still and hollow night We saw stray cats and hooting owls, And from the chords of your guitar A seismic force shook the world.&#xA;Buildings burned; people screamed; regimes collapsed. The smell of blood + fire took my nostrils.&#xA;I fell on my broken knees. A brick split upon my head. Ash clouded my eyes. The unanimous groans of a condemned world Could not drown your voice.</description>

      <description>When the Nation&amp;rsquo;s day is finally done, And the Rockefellers have no more fun, And the fever finds its source, And the project runs its course: None will weep at America&amp;rsquo;s last breath, When the yoeman-bourgeois reaches its death. If mine&amp;rsquo;s been beaten, enslaved, riddled with strife, Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t yours end early? You&amp;rsquo;ve had an air conditioner your whole life.</description>
