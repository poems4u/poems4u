    <p>If beauty has one immutible, intersubjective quality, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
is is transience. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Like a lightning bolt from above, it flashes for but an instance in the grand scheme of things, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and then it is gone&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>On Friday, I passed it in its sublimity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Halted in my tracks as if it were a wall. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
On Monday, in its place was death, decay, disgust, dread. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I covered my mouth and ran just to trip and fall, to lie there, in that salinity, prostrate, for some time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Today, I went back. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Even in my abject despair I felt that the outline which held such a delicate quality should be revered, remembered. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I was scared and unprepared, armed with only paper towel and plastic bag, but no one else took notice, and so the task fell to me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Now there&rsquo;s dirt under my fingernails&hellip;</p>
<p>Could such a thing exist external to finitude? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Only the philosopher knows.
If we could just ask him, maybe he would say <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
there really is an eternal beauty in itself, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
up there, and if you&rsquo;re good, after you leave you can see it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
You&rsquo;ll sit there smiling, sighing next to Diotima, forever.</p>
<p>Or, she would simply remind us that if it can be lost, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
it was never really ours to begin with.</p>
