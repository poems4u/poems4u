<p>A swift flick, swerve
Placed us here
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> In this grey-washed atrium
watching television on the
floor- they gave us nowhere to sit
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Even in that moment I felt
a strange lilt in my heart
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two bulls:
dumb, headstrong, naive, smug,
stubborn, and born with a
recalcitrant need to be known
made use of, and loved.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Oceans in our eyes
and rainforests in our hearts
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Besides that, nothing in common.
But still, you saw me smile
and wheeled or wobbled over
to attend to me.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Last I saw you, it was there,
with that poor, poor girl
(elle, elle est morte
elle est morte
et lorsque tu te rends ce compte&hellip;)
And there were bugs under
my skin.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->And you told me of my future
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->And hung your head
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->And asked if I forgave you
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I said yes, and meant it -
that&rsquo;s why I haven&rsquo;t called since</p>
