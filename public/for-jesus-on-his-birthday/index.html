<p>I was 6 years in the desert
Self-exiled, by my own power
All gold once found then became dirt
Heart-housed demons them they showered</p>
<p>There, whencefrom buried to my neck
Came forth my savior with eyes kind
Not as knight, me to pull from wreck,
But sickle-celled black man, lame, blind.</p>
<p>Snow from his nose poured on my head-
&ldquo;My poor child destroyed in his self,
Foolish to think that you are dead<br>
Undying light offers his help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forthwith I felt it, though unseen
Augmented in strength, thence I lept
Towards a star, glorious sheen
I stayed grounded, though my feet left</p>
<p>The sand, to be planted on top
The wilted flower of my soul
Through immense, undeserved love
It will be prayed, and there it shall grow</p>
<p>Water only will come when asked
Even in drought, often the plant
Reaches for growth with its own grasp
It then shrinks, without the rain, damned</p>
<p>But then is reminded of that
Undying love which lies in wait
Though unworthy, He has not spat
But cried tears of joy, far from hate</p>
<p>So that his precious flower may then grow
Only beseeching that it Him may know.</p>
