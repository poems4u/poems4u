    <p>For free, handing out poems on the street, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
E&rsquo;en the reading man disliked my stuff: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>&ldquo;When all is black it&rsquo;s y&rsquo;all who lack sight&rsquo;s ability, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
For nothing has no hues, like sterility.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>He suggested a medium treat <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Meant of all that which I love. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The musician who in underemployment wallows, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Reveals his enjoyment such as follows: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Beauty, though whole, is expressed in privational difference, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So I love all poems, even libational limericks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Beauty&rsquo;s true identity is metaphysical music, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So I love communication absent language, flesh lucid. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Even film, writing, fashion–beauty in sounds and images <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Are music too when their power isn&rsquo;t viewed as limited. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So I love art, especially the finest work of them all– <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The world! God&rsquo;s gift to himself, wherefrom the clench of evil&rsquo;s jaw <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Was birthed. Without it we could see no good. Made separate from God, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We only see beauty limited. We (not Him) have a job. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We of two natures, being and not, have choice of life or death. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Most choose the latter, scared of what crouches in between breaths, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But this is foolish. When death dies life goes back to where it&rsquo;s from. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
If life and death are love and fear, it&rsquo;s clear to know which to want. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So I&rsquo;ll tell you what love to love, it starts within the body– <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Walking, dancing, shouting; muscles aching and noses snotty; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When the heart beats so fast that it is felt inside of the head, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Or the calm serenity of limbs working to make a bed; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Tripping and falling and breaking the skin while playing a sport, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Or granting legs mobility by in summer wearing shorts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Whether cooking or eating, in pleasantries or pain, know this: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Inside all the sensations of the body is where love is. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Next comes language–mindless nonsense as the philosopher knows. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Into the heart and not the brain do spoken and written word go. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Schizophrenically, sounds are thought to have a concrete meaning; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Really, they lie prostrate before us as a mirror gleaming. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
What is intimated to others as hateful derision <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Can bring joy to another listener; it&rsquo;s their decision. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&ldquo;My left toe respires as watches the wall friend Mary Sue,&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Could drive one to suicide, to another is &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So hear as you wish. Speak from the stomach. Remain undaunted. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
If love is in each word, evil loses his rhodomontade. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Whereof nature–plants and animals and flying and creeping things, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Mountains and valleys, the ocean and creeks? All together sing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The sting of a wasp can be read as a novel encounter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Flies can be released from your house without death or disaster. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Trees rustling and creaking in the wind is a song made by two, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And if he caves in your roof be glad that nature has touched you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The sun beating down on a crow which makes him scream and holler <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Also drives you to the store, buying beer with your last dollar. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And I hope you didn&rsquo;t think that we were outside of nature.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
There&rsquo;s no demarcation between those whose lack the same crater, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
For we all spend our days extracting desires from planet Earth. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Even the machines are singing, because they know well their worth. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Have you ever heard of &ldquo;Landslide?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a song by Fleetwood Mac; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
It&rsquo;s a cover of the same song rocks play thrust down mountains&rsquo; backs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
You have permission to love violence, for it resides in us all. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
There is no good and evil, right and wrong; there is only law. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When God made the world He put no evil in it, just difference. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Fullness is forbidden in this life–don&rsquo;t you try to spin it <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Into some nasty narrative about getting all that you want. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Pain is the cost of enforcing distinguishment. Being blunt, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
There is no purpose to feeling despair–everything is art, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Which is really the first link in the chain, acting as a start <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
From art, which is beauty, which is music, which, indeed, is love, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Which is life, which is being, which is our God above. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But there is that which I love most of all: those poor in spirit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Who read and saw the Word but never had the chance to hear it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Those hurt, taken from, found in circumstances unrequested. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Those on whom violence has a toll but go on unmolested. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
They will inherit all the knowledge to see that which is love, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
which is the Earth, which is God, who is the stars, which is enough.</p>
