    <p>Out of love and out of time, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
It&rsquo;s true the last year ought&rsquo;ve plagued my mind, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But I still feel the need to look inside <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
A live mind <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To find what live there is inside after it already died. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Indeed, there were some wheels and satellites still spinning, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Even as it looked little little like it did before. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Whatever game you&rsquo;ve gleaned to be losing or winning, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
You&rsquo;ll find that you you once were is there no more. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And no matter how bad we&rsquo;d like to break this pattern, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Can&rsquo;t nothing bring Sun Ra on back from Saturn. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Even if the reaper does come for ol&rsquo; Testicular Torsion Tim, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Whose left necrotic nut would be generously given to him, <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>He will never return to Planet Earth, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Will never accept entropic loss as sufficient sacrifice, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Will never take trash to show us our worth. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Still, it&rsquo;s nice to recognize <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That God is in that piece of trash, too, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As are all the bits of old me and older you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As a result, I cannot suppress the shame <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Of an instance when last Monday a click beetle walked through our door frame. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I was called on and told a demon came in for dinner, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Despite the holy water. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Two grown men hollering hither <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To see a brown bug so big it could&rsquo;ve been Kronos&rsquo;s Father. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Quoth, &ldquo;scared and unprepared,&rdquo; the presumed roach <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Was to be sent forth from his hiding, the knave, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And chased out the front door. Our space he&rsquo;d not encroach <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
All so that his disgusting and unworthy life might be saved. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But I played too fast and too loose. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
On his head fell the rack of shoes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Still, he limped his way out the front door <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
all while furiously clicking: &ldquo;Nevermore!&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>By opening his mouth to speak he revealed himself <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Not a roach. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And I felt my mind clarified <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To imagine him terrified; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I felt gross. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Me, with my contingent consciousness and mystical wealth <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Somehow believed I was more entitled than him. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I saw it! I risked his life on whim. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And if a tree really feels no trauma <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Then whereof all this drama <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Of Uprooting the earth? An Aristotelian attempt at going home <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Fails devastatingly. At best his time on Earth reduced to loam <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As will befall all of us, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Ash to ash and dust to dust. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny in the same way with women and men, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Who massacre and slaughter to keep pink or keep red <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When they&rsquo;re really just a touch of white apart, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As with race and with art. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>All this and I still despair <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
At my destiny of waking up as my high school band director and living his life: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Fat and fundamentalist, no potential to have ever been squandered, no friends and no hair <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
With melted children and mennonite wife. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to be optimistic, to know what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s not <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When on the first day of June it doesn&rsquo;t smell like it should in the foothills of the Appalachian Piedmont. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Still, if you were to ask me whether I&rsquo;d rather keep my testicle sinister or those that left last July, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
In a poem I cannot write a lie. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
