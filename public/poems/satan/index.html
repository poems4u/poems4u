    <p>When, when he snubbed his nose at me <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Oh, how I bristled with delight. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Nothing but evil could he be <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
who took such pleasure in my plight. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It was already known, the thought <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
which bore its way into his mind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Serreptitious there, demon bought <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Solely for pleasure of its kind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But when the dog steals all the food <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Or when a child, denied, does cry, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lsquo;Twas by a Spinozistic mode <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Those barbaric desires fly <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Into the poor and ill-restrained <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
mechanical animal mind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
How could impulsed thoughts be detained <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
in faculties considered blind? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>With me it&rsquo;s much in the same way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
My simple heart, incapable <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Of begrudging malice in day <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
In moonlight turns implacable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And as such light shines through the grove, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And the pinewood smells of winter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The trees dropped leaves- It wasn&rsquo;t chose <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
more than such frost in December, <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But mine enemy loves his sole free will <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
One God amongst all men, henceforth to kill. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
