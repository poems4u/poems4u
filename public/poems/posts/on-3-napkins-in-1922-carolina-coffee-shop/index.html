    <p>N.1 <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
If all was light, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I will go where I am led <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and through this giving thanks, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
may I be brought into what <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I would always become, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and may my heart quicken in gladness <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
at the thought of doing it again. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>N.2 <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
If it&rsquo;s true that the two primary emotions are fear and love, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and that they are mutually exclusive, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Then maybe FDR did nothing wrong, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and to be afraid is to let the evil <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
of the world enter your heart. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
It would like to make you believe you have <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
everything to lose; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
nothing could be further from the truth. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>N.3 <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
If, in the end, mediocrity reigns, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
then may I be exceptional or awful. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
If, in the time passing, philosophy <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
was spoken through literature, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
then may I live a life of art <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
with no writing or speaking. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
