    <p>One realizes when they go out west. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That so many have never seen a real southern belle twink before. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
A prophet is never recognized is his own home, at best, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And so i like to see things I’ve never seen before. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The south is so provincial in ways we often forget. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Here, it’s a phone booth every couple blocks, most neighborhoods have a community garden, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Sundry others which beget, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Freedom, but somehow, with such amenities, hearts harden. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We don’t quite know why, but despite <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Spinning signs and sky trams and queers and vegans <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And $18 cocktails they put on fire and police that are lenient, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Most find the ground more enlivening than the city’s light. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Still, there’s something about riding the light-rail 50 minutes to the “beach.” <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Wait, sorry, that was in Wilmington, in the 1920s— Lumina. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Sauvie Island isn’t something they’ll have you reach <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Lest you’re a corpse floating down the Columbia. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So y’all can keep y’all’s sidewalks and y’all’s prosperity and pride. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I’ll take the Corpus Christi procession on Fordham Boulevard. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I’ll take the haziness, the laziness, the gloom of gazes that wish to deride <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Me. In exchange I’ll get something vague about a bahia’d summer yard. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>///////////////////////////////////////</p>
<p>And it often makes me sad <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That folks would rather stay inside. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I like TV, but also being bad <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And seeking the encounter with that from which they hide. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Solemnly slovenly, i met a bumblebee on the porch, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Seeking respite while the devil beat on his wife. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I told her about going to church, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And she told me about her life, <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Which was really quite contained, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But she knew of those who lived in a place <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Where you could hear the flowers gossip. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Where, in a certain stillness, you could see the meeting of the four winds, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Could go from whence the sky and sea blossom, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Or spend a long time finding a hermit or a tree <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To convince <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To share the knowledge that be <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
In the heart of that not often sought, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Neither within a mirror, nor something bought. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And that damn bastard old fucking crow jeered and hollered <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As i maniacally drew up my plans. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
He knew others couldn’t be bothered <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
By the wild waving and gesturing of my hands. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>My bee friend bade me the end fared-well <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As I lumbered back onto the screen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Despite my best efforts, I couldn’t tell <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Why that damn old rotten crow had to be so mean. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>///////////////////////////////////////</p>
<p>And there will come a day, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When youth will pass away. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
What will they say <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
About me? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
