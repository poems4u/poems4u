    <h1>Ask The Bugs; They&#39;ll Tell You</h1>

    

    <p>They Said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve been speaking with the moon. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
She told us to ask you a question&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
He wants to know if you&rsquo;re coming home soon. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Additionally, we have a suggestion—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>She&rsquo;d like to show you something you&rsquo;ve never seen before. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
She&rsquo;s in her spot and has meticulously marked and set the stage—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Hark! Hence draws desirous drippings; she adds without rancour <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That you <em>already</em> know who burnt down the house with sage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, on her in the clearing I fixed my attention, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And all my paranoia withdrew in abstention.</p>
<p>And I remembered the homily by Fr. Edward Burch, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Who, one Thursday afternoon, said to the Church</p>
<p>That anytime he asked God would take him to Fátima. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And like the aliens took Black Herman away to Africa</p>
<p>I was thence whisked yonder from out the grove—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Goodbye, dark night! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Goodbye, greasied stove! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Goodbye, stars! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Goodbye, bugs! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Goodbye, cows! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Goodbye, halves of hugs <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And half a house! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I landed then far undergound inside The Cave, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Where Diotima twerked on Socrates——dubious rave.</p>
