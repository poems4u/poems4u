<p>You kept me from the hills of Spain <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and locked up in a book <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
to heap desires upon my soul in pain.</p>
<p>You had a joke at me, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
from beyond, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
at my shouts into the black <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
which echoed back,</p>
<p>and it split your sides <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
to see my eyes <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
turned to the skies <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
when all the manna farms laid fallow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not laughed in my entire life—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

a dark cloud descended down, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and out stretched a hand holding spatula <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and Burger King crown,</p>
<p>and you ignored and fear-faltered—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I heard you trip and fall at the altar:</p>
<p>there were hills in your own backyard.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe you, if you were so worried <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
you could&rsquo;ve posted Palestine Instagram Stories.&rdquo;</p>
