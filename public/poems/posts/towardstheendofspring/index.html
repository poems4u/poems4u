    <p>“Somehow, someway, it all comes alive again, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
From contingency being grows wings to fly, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Always becoming what it might have been, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But i get sad when cicadas die. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yes, there are millions of them, and they all look the same. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
They’re dumb and can’t see very well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
They’re loud and can get in the way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But oh, if they don’t sound the much needed bell <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That the day of judgement has arrived. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When we’re all called to step out our graves. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When sir brother sun has us reaching for that denied <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Desire to which we all must be a slave: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To live! And they have it too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
They waited underground unlike me and you <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To see what was promised for 17 years blind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Imagine, what do you have in mind <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In terms of what it must be like to emerge <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And at once see it all, to gain wings and go <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Up as high as you can simply to perch <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And sing so loud you don’t even know <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
How loud you are <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To those below? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Near and far <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
High and low <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A mile away can you sing! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Can hear the product of your triumph and work, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Can hear the living tolls of spring, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Can hear the alarm, life alert. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And we were blessed to have the advantage <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That these angels are only benign. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
How, of all, did we manage <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To not have the xylem that they like? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We can be friends with them, unlike so many others <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Who bite or scratch or sting at us, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And wouldn’t you be sad if one of your friend’s mothers <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Went out for a stroll and got hit by a bus? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Alas, they are massacred and hated for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Their corpses litter the ground and the street. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
You confound them with your automobiles and concrete, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And you all get off on your privilege to ignore it <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Your profit seeking soul refuses to see; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
They sing up there all day for free <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And i lost some trees, and i loved some plants, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And i loved sometimes to go and dance, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But we all have those we never gave a chance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I, like everyone else, step on the ants.”</p>
