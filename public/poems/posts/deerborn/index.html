<p>Glory, Glory, etc..</p>
<p>The men who write the fact&rsquo;ries, build the laws, and hire the crew <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Will find that they destroyed that what their poor minds had in view, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And some will seek to shape the world on what they thought was new, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But what they wanted* is gone!</p>
<p>Glory, Glory, etc..</p>
<p>And when, on the horizon, I&rsquo;ll the last time rouse from bed <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And see that my old landlord&rsquo;s come a-knockin&rsquo; for my head, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I&rsquo;ll holler for the children, tell them &ldquo;run and get the reds!&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But they&rsquo;ve since all marched along!</p>
<p>Glory, Glory, etc..</p>
