    <h1>For Jesus, On His Birthday</h1>

    

    <p>I was 6 years in the desert <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Self-exiled, by my own power. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
All gold once found then became dirt <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Heart-housed demons them they showered. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There, whencefrom buried to my neck <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Came forth my savior with eyes kind <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Not as knight, me to pull from wreck, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But sickle-celled black man, lame, blind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Snow from his nose poured on my head- <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&ldquo;My poor child destroyed in his self, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Foolish to think that you are dead  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Undying light offers his help.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Forthwith I felt it, though unseen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Augmented in strength, thence I lept <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Towards a star, glorious sheen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I stayed grounded, though my feet left <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The sand, to be planted on top. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The wilted flower of my soul <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Through immense, undeserved love <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
It will be prayed, and there it shall grow. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Water only will come when asked. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Even in drought, often the plant <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Reaches for growth with its own grasp. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
It then shrinks, without the rain, damned, <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But then is reminded of that <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Undying love which lies in wait <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Though unworthy, He has not spat <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But cried tears of joy, far from hate, <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So that his precious flower may then grow <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Only beseeching that it Him may know. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
