    <p>The gears done ground and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
ground ungears</p>
<p>so that those little wildflowers—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
the ones that only grow under <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
perpetual humming conditions—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and the endless mammoned memories dug <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
up from the plithy hollowed ground <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
sustaining them—— —— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
can go unnoticed.</p>
<p>One reached the red mantle first <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and woulnd&rsquo;t do of it <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
because him and all his knew friends <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
that green was the winning mantle color—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
red <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
being the losing color.</p>
<p>And red was the flag that a-flared <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
up little moustache and goatee threw <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
up when it saw</p>
<p>yezhoved out of the engraving <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
into an unspeakable</p>
<p>God with no beard at all.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t of been <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
for that matter <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
as all the follicles <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
even the pubes <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
were deep-soiled such that his <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
face the only commons in law</p>
<p>enclosed and razed <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
then opened. Once glazed</p>
<p>shut again all jaws</p>
<p>for fear and for shame.</p>
<p>But, no. Wrong. Go read your history: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
y&rsquo;all need to stop asking why I won&rsquo;t shave all the hair off my body.</p>
