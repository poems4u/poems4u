    <h1>Dying Poinsettia in Our Window</h1>

    

    <p>She lived, like Anna, in a chapel <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Until Father, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Behest of Pastor, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Sent her away, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Because Christmas was over.</p>
<p>She came home with us, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And I was envious of her soft yet textured <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Red dress <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And green trimming.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she liked the window. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Though she would always smile back at me, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
She once asked where all tthe reds and blues <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And yellows and greens had gone.</p>
<p>I liked to watch her, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Plumage at altar, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Swept in the careening dance of light, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Standing up tall and full.</p>
<p>By mid-January, she developed a cough <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And asked if God would come to visit, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As they had once been roommates <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And loved each other dearly.</p>
<p>I told her she ought to know better—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And she agreed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s warming now, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
early, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And bored, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Lonely, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
She slouches towards despair.</p>
<p>Undressing, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
She leaves her gown on the floor, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
More shit to stick to my feet.</p>
