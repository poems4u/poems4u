    <p>This <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
for the and not for me:</p>
<p>He locked up all the doors and tore <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
out his eyes and tongue.</p>
<p>Stick fire up on in his nose <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and made sure to blow out his hears</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what that was yeaah <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
we all had to ear it.</p>
<p>Of course, the tactile was on issue <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
so he got me to cut out his spinal cord.</p>
<p>No, i&rsquo;m not sure if it worked <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
knows he can&rsquo;t tell me, Lord.</p>
<p>yeah, You can try. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We&rsquo;ll bust on up in there and You can <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
can gone and give eem a kick square <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
in the back of the head <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and see what answers if
Thisness is left.</p>
<p>He was worried bout the now, yeah <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
but he wouldn&rsquo;t let me touch on him brain.</p>
<p>I think he was hoping it would just follow</p>
<p>like when You cut off one hinge <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and the whole thing falls——</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really stupid idea.</p>
