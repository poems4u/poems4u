    <h1>Before All Ages</h1>

    

    <p>The orbiters gesticulated there; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Monorails glided along in silence, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
While flashing lights indifferently got glares <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
From beams and passengers coldly quiet. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Indeed as were his architecture plans <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To conjure more flimsy wire and concrete,<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Revealed to me by Trojan and Greek hands, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Flanking our Jupiter ninety degrees <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
On both sides. On hexagonal shaped streets</p>
<p>                                                  Stood I</p>
<p>                                                  On Saturn,</p>
<p>Whose ouroboros rail it wounds round and round; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Janus reports on the unseen and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Knot <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
,Which, tied at the planet core, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Holds fast us to its revolutions qua time.</p>
<p>Watching the thrall over there <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Contribute nothing to the accursed share— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Some dig in their heels up to their knees and are quietly pushed along regardless, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
While others fight and fight to get halves of inches ahead, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Throwing life away like Malian gold at naive efforts to become unharnessed, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Which, of course, they will only be when they are dead. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Seeing all this outside First Father’s <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Grasp <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Did I for my space telephone <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And requested to meet with Kronos’s keeper. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>They took me down through the cloud cover and metal hydrogen <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Into a forest of grass; attended by small men <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Was the leader with whom I wanted to speak: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A being hairy legg-ed, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
With sets of eight legs and eyes- <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
‘Twas me he reprimanded; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Purring, he told me no lies.</p>
<p>The undulations of his throat me assured: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
                                                  That anything <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
                                                  That is not <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
                                                  Everything <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
          Must be contained,<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>          That it was a kind contract, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
          And all to whom <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
          It bound <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>          Would be released <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
                                                  In the end. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>                                                  For that matter, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
                                                  It was all illusory, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
                                                  And that it <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
                                                  Would be best <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
                                                  If all should <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
                                                  Need to toil <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
                                                  Under the sun <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
                                                  For their prophet. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Thus, I was kindly but firmly escorted <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
          To Rhea, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
          Who hid me away <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So that my complaints I may not suffer, <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But I could still see <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Jupiter’s one eye, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Whose convections bore their way into my mind <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And left me with a centrifuge of mush. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As knows Uranus, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Who, though existing as the outer bounds of space which we weren’t permitted the speed to crack, decided to rest his soul <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>                       At the center of it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
