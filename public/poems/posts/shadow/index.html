    <p>&ldquo;I was the first to have heard. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I published the newspapers on that day. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I was the one they deigned absurd, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But when the sea parted, who else made way? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
No one else discovered the third <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
In King David&rsquo;s little psalms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
None else flew——two-winged bird—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
While they hid faces in palms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When each one in their cowardice deferred, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Only I dared speak the truth, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When, as with age, the wisdom was transferred, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lsquo;Twas I who occupied the youth. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And while the conspirators conferred, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I laid down to rest. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
My mouth closed, their speech slurred—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Bedlam by the &lsquo;blessed.&rsquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
In every wretch, in every turd, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
There is a little bit of me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
If ignorant, they&rsquo;ve strayed the herd: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Rest assured—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Rest refused to be interred, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
While all the powers oppose—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So little can be inferred <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
By the findings of the nose, <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But I took care of that, after all; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I was what they used to write the law.</p>
<p>And it broke my heart when Simon lied <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When simply faced with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
