    <h1>In Search of Fort Ocracoke</h1>

    

    <p>Call did the Major Briggs <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
For all the able bodied men. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
He called them to kneel——to dig. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
While cedars trembled in the wind</p>
<p>They sailed their way to Beacon Mound <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To render convex their earthen hole—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Built a hollow cone forth the ground <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And desired the Union to lull <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Over the rocky shoals and shallows. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Savages aground, they&rsquo;d show themselves, numbered sixty——<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Would defend their island home hallowed <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And slaughter all the enemy.</p>
<p>But their merucurial minds failed to comprehend <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When fell Hatteras and Roanoake and Macon. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Without one shot their war found its end—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Insignificance——Butler refused to slay them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So they packed their bags, their armaments and powder <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And pushed their &ldquo;fort&rdquo; into the sea. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Pamlicoan backwardnes and grief sounded louder <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When the only fantasy failed to be.</p>
<p>They returned to their huts and hovels—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
They returned to their fishing stations, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And oyster shells filled what was taken by shovels, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And they redoubted their tiny nation.</p>
<p>Some would later fight inland and lose their life, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So small-scale replicated was the hole as family graves, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Whence ere now the corpses roll in strife, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Knowing soon their world reduced to waves.</p>
