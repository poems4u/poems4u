    <p>A force <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Which compulses contortions in your face, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Sends spasms through your body, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Induces irregular emotional intervals—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Music!</p>
<p>Positioned above a chair, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Beside a tea candle, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Under which was a table, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Were two ears—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
A head sat between them <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And so on.</p>
<p>Then a old man came out, and the lights dimmed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We dove in vibrational pools and swam—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Shouts and giggles, respectful frowns and grins—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&ldquo;Boom! Buddlii-a-deet, boom-bum-badum bam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silly sheepish smile towards the laughing couple behind me <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As I went for a(nother) tall Slovenian cab.</p>
<p>Energy sent into the audience, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
With little remorse and lacking constraint. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
It had its way with me——so obvious <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That where I had felt it, wrinkles remained.</p>
<p>[They think that if Death saw them there, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Without the marks of time, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
He&rsquo;d pass them, oh but they forget <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That little babies die :((]</p>
<p>After the show, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Because it was clear by the timing of my hollers and spasms that I knew what I was hearing, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
A woman slightly aged for my taste was looking at me with big and unreciprocated eyes <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And asked me what I played—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I said Mahjong, games, tricks, pranks, jokes, Mario, house, and mermaids. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I told her she ought to listen to more Sun Ra——for the sake of her soul.</p>
<p>And when her inebriated twink, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Who looked like a xerox of a xerox of someone I once knew, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Came over and touched me on the shoulder <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And asked me what I played <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I said Nothing, Just Listen.</p>
<p>I quickly went on my way, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and you&rsquo;ll have to understand <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Sometimes that <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Violent imagery doesn&rsquo;t mean that something is bad or wicked or contemptable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>What I mean is, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Never, before being in that room, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
not at Disney World, or mass, or McDonald&rsquo;s, or the beach, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Had I seen so many smiling eyes.</p>
