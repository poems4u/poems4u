    <h1>Explain Yourself!</h1>

    

    <p>Well&hellip;. I- I have a diagnosis, you know.</p>
<p>It means there&rsquo;s something wrong with me&hellip; but they don&rsquo;t know what.</p>
<p>I imagine it&rsquo;s very hard for them, trying to figure that for a time or so, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
every now and then.</p>
<p>I have a body and other physical characteristics, but I suppose that isn&rsquo;t what you mean.</p>
<p>I mean, that hasn&rsquo;t really got anything to do with ME, does it?</p>
<p>Sure, I have feelings, even beliefs, but they only come in for dinner or supper, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
even tea, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I&rsquo;d say, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Then they go merrily on their way.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need me, you know.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re as squalid little roommates who never pick up after themselves——</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure they must have somewhere they go on to after me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Why else would they be in such a hurry to leave?</p>
<p>So that part&rsquo;s difficult to account, if you&rsquo;ll pardon my deficiency.</p>
<p>If we used that for measure, it&rsquo;d be impossible to reckon how I could at all be the same thing I was as yesterday.</p>
<p>I suppose what <em>does</em> stick around is that constant state of bewilderment.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is myself, then: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
He who looks at the mess created by his cohabitants and throws up his hands <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and away to the corner, usually to sulk.</p>
<p>Sometimes he tries to find it in a book, you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Know?</em> No. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That won&rsquo;t do at all. Please begin again, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
like so:</p>
<p><em>My name is Shea, and I like to play.</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>I like to dance, and I like to prance.</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>I like to sing and like silly things</em>. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>I often cry, but I really try——</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>I really try to do good deeds.</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>Tell me; what does your name mean?</em>&rdquo;</p>
