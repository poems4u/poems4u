<p>&ldquo;May it please the court, and may I first present <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That Mrs. Babbitt came to The Bay with God&rsquo;s assent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
In Trump&rsquo;s America, it was allowed <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That Mr. Babbitt be seen as well-endowed <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
(Monitarily, of course), and though she was worthless <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Was proud to be named Queen of The Pool Service. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And when the feds called the loan, she was too retarded <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To make any sense of it, she started <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
With the Pizzagate and the cabal, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And the homeless, immigrants——the wall <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That she climbed——in her pocket a knife, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And for the brief moment &lsquo;fore the end of her life <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
She got to feel in charge of her fate; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
A creature so useless been forced to wait <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
for any sense of agency, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Judge, and Michael, y&rsquo;all know me, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
How I was appointed by Him to know <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The faults and fallings of the masses below. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We all can see, act of creation aside, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That it&rsquo;s best for all beings this varmit had died. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
She cowered and raged of her own ineptitude—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
She never helped one, and when left destitute <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
She shrilled her impotent voice—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Her Cro-Magnon mind came caught in the noise—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
No soul, no loss,,,all disgrace—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Your Honor, opposing counsel, I rest my case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge turned to Michael, who, swallowed in thought, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Stared blankly down upon the evidence he had brought, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And inside his mind was the consideration <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Of every person, of every nation, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Of different values, of different words, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Of countless deaths and several births—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
He saw two factions——on either side of the street <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Stood them, calling on the others to weep <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
For their sins: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve ruined our country! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Should they be culled all would be lovely!&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Sees the blind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And so our Michael knew the mind <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Of Sulla, his believers, all their kind: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Stalin and Robespierre, Sâr and Gonzalo, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Hitler and Urban II, Polk and Tojo, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Even Lenin required his Dzerzhinsky—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And the angel considered intently <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That Christman would suffer middle-aged stroke, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That O B would crash out and burn all that he wrote, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That Lana would marry a crocodile hunter, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That a boy in Some Place would be torn asunder <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
With no recourse as to who or how or why. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Poor Michael then started to cry <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As he foresaw Buncombe&rsquo;s coming retribution, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And he was reminded while in state of confusion <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Of his own powerlessness in the face of The Plan <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Which wouldn&rsquo;t let him save a drowning woman or starving man, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And he saw the place he once knew as Eden <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Washed away, broke down, defeated. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Former glory must be redoubted, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So in court he was astounded <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To vision had fallen among the formerly well-known tree. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Poor Ashli&rsquo;s council could only reply: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>&ldquo;May God rebuke thee!&rdquo;</p>
