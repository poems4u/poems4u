    <h1>Alcoholism 1 (Minqi of A Bathroom——Han Dynsasty)</h1>

    

    <p>Somehow, the mullet breached the sea wall <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To terrorize the neighborhood with their squelching—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Constantly sucking debris into their maws, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And the endemic AC hum isn&rsquo;t helping. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Another night sat illicitly, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As the school sought to swallow <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <br>
One half of symmetry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Reflected on the lake within the hollow</p>
<p>Was a brightly lit home partitioned by palm. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Subtle piano notes sounded about the air, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But those frenzied fish disquited the calm—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
A thought was inserted: it wasn&rsquo;t fair <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That nobody told Narcissus <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That what he saw was something other. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And nobody told the fishes <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That algal blooms them would smother.</p>
<p>And nobody told me <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That Dionysus snuck in through the back. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
All was handled it seemed, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lsquo;Til suddenly resounded a whack!</p>
<p>Thence were two figures—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
One kneeled over, the other holding her up; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Fall risks misfigured <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When none have wine left in the cup.</p>
<p>How could one even bring a pinecone to South Flordia? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Now that is dedication! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
It was an ironic miracle, like the menorah, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That <em>he</em> withstood inebriation.</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;s it matter to have burning oil anyway? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I&rsquo;d rather have fish and bread——and drink! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Whence he laughed——rod and staff would stay <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As I spewed $350 into the sink.</p>
