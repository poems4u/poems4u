    <h1>As I Went Down to The River to Pray...</h1>

    

    <p>A diverted interlude, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Sheltered in the covet <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Of a slanted tree, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Which ran up to my ankles.</p>
<p>Actually, it was two. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
One which covered half,<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And the other, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Which grew almost parallel <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To the flowing glass, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Before curving up from the bank.</p>
<p>He then sloped down and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Placed a foot on the riverbed, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Completing the aforementioned—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Covet in pavilion style.</p>
<p>And if one were to grow <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Brave and step <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Out from the denier <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Of the Sun&rsquo;s patterns <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Into the carcinogenic light,</p>
<p>They would see <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
A clear soil which held <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Tall and bush patches of grass <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And the sidelining trees making <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
A line of demarcation for <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Pure fleuvian beauty.</p>
<p>They too would see <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The cradle—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The parabola binding a <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Non-turbid sky and its whitewater—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Where our brother the Sun could each dusk <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Rest his heavy neck.</p>
