    <h1>Perpendicular Intersection</h1>

    

    <p>When put on Earth, received all their own Job: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So Elihu, with lies disguised as truths, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Whose &ldquo;I am&rdquo; bears cogito of Magog, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Will come to those whose faith bears rotten fruit.</p>
<p>I saw one <em>Enallagma Basidens</em>, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Who, gliding low on surface glassied creek, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Would then consent his clasp to go within, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Thereafter she was drowned: submerg-ed stick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a shame that we will never know <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Who said one night under the Palace roof: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&ldquo;When Sun comes out, him rising from below, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
His sister Lilith hides not her dark moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gestated fear, when brought to term, won&rsquo;t bend, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Though he desires his self to be concrete, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
For that which he abhorred becomes the end, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As doorstep demons get two kisses sweet.</p>
