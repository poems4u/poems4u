    <h1>Vienna, 1913: Discalced Trinity</h1>

    

    <p><em>Painter:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>He saw me there. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Fuck! Fuck! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
He saw me <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
In my stupid stupid trapper hat.</p>
<p>He laughed at me, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Because I was on the bike <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
In my work clothes, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Debased, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Layered and fat and soles falling <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Out everywhere—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
It&rsquo;s not my fault it&rsquo;s fucking cold!</p>
<p>He, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Off to some function or soirée <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Surely <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
(He once laughed at my Belvedere!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Without a care.</p>
<p>You oughta <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Tell them <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To let me back into the school.</p>
<p><em>Analyst:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I saw him there. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Hah! Hah! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I saw him <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In his self-imposed degraded state, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And he the one told me to wait <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
For his tardy and limping pretense nonsense! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I was too busy, in my office</p>
<p>Listening and writing over the head <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Of a man who was mute unless while in bed, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And he tinkered in that which I like to dabble <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
(And he wasn&rsquo;t half bad in naught but a towel).</p>
<p>Still, I found nothing to compel him to speak, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And my failure in turn made me old and quite weak. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
More weak, though, the other&rsquo;s figure rent me: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So lithe and framed: all that was not sent me.</p>
<p>Enough! let him writhe in his squalor: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
He tried to blame what he did on his Father. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We must be quick! Autumn is on the wing, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And I&rsquo;ll be damned if he should bloom again come spring!</p>
<p><em>Vagrant:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I am still there, around the river bend <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Or scaled the mountain, high upon the crest. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The cattle said my offer to rescind: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That neither of them earned to be my guest.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll trick the painter, let us dress in black <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And, with the newsman, haunt him in his dreams, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And you, my doctor dear, will also lack, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
For I shall leave you for the glitt&rsquo;ring streams.</p>
<p>I am there, telling secrets in the lot, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Awaiting starlight: savior of half-truths—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I&rsquo;m bitter. All my secrets they forgot. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I laid them in the crypt, inside their tomb.</p>
<p>And in my goss&rsquo;mer blouse to see the Duke, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I stop halfway——beside the creek to puke.</p>
