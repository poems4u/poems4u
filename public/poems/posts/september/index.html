    <p>     1882: Nietzsche tears through the heavenly veil to find the Body of God, dead for 300 years. The corpse was rotting; maggot demons crawled through all His divine orifices, and the blood from the wound made centuries ago continued to gush forth, invisible to the naked eye, pouring like a monsoon on the realm of the demiurge, drowning all of humanity in ordained monadity.</p>
<p>     C. 50: The remaining druids secretly gather in the Scottish Hills to perform a final ritual. A circle of 75 surrounds a giant wicker statue in the guise of some sort of synthesis between the Divus Augustus and Quirinus. Inside the statue is a Roman Centurion; the druids prepare their spell. As they perform the rites, fire is set to the wicker man, and several chalices of hemlock are passed among those performing. In the final throes, the druids throw their life force into the space-time manifold, all the souls converge not but several hundred miles from their current location, centuries into the future.</p>
<p>     1578: after being visited by the Archangel Uriel, John Dee is given the secret book of Yaldabaoth, from which he learns the secret of magic and his own historical role. He does not consult his queen regent, Elizabeth, nor any prominent members of the court, for doing so would make the task impossible, it happened as follows:</p>
<p>          1459: Abaddon, in the wicked night, visits                     Thomas Stanley and takes his life.</p>
<p>          1484: Richard III is killed, and Henry VII                     becomes King of England.</p>
<p>     1517: Beelzebub, dressed in the clothes of the LORD, leads Martin Luther across the realms of inferno to the supreme altar. In the icy caves of the 9th circle is a figure chained. Luther is told that it is the demiurge itself. Beelzebub instructs Luther to strike the imminent blade through its heart, to liberate man from his shackles and allow for individual communion with God——Heaven on Earth. Luther wondered aloud why he was chosen for the task. Beelzebub explained: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
« History goes through cycles. As I am sure you are aware, the current world exists in a time of upheaval. The Church has grown evil with the influence from the demiurge; they seek only to fulfill worldly concerns. However, the demiurge has spread itself too thin, its remaining power is not enough to protect its corporeal form. You must eliminate its hold binding humanity. Its blood will spill and dissolve the ties of this old, wicked Church. Only you, in this exact event, can rally the people to destroy the old world, and birth forth anew. » <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Luther, enticed by Beelzebub’s trick, plunges the knife-event through the heart of God. The world shakes as blood gushes from the wound. Beelzebub takes his flight and Luther triumphs as he watches ties violently unbinding.</p>
<p>     1976: The last general in the army of God is usurped. Mao Zedong died on this day, his Red Guardians shuffled to the countryside as Deng Xiaoping welcomed the demons of Yaldabaoth into China.</p>
<p>     2022: Queen Elizabeth II died 2 days ago. Called by the name of the one once defied, she ruled in a neutered state. Her only privilege: to be granted a front-row seat as ancient apocalyptic magic ran over the surface of the earth, destroying old orders to be replaced with the new. She watched her subjects ordered along <em>éthiques de l&rsquo;enfer</em>. Each person has a contractual role to aid in the building of Hell on Earth. Each capitalist subject, drunk on the blood of God, will now be God qua individual. This undialectical balance will soon cause the world to erupt in flames.</p>
<p>     1890: The Lakota perform their final Ghost Dance.</p>
