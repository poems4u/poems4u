    <p>Three of us in the tub <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
On the side of the stage.</p>
<p>The pastor, my father, a drowned wolf spider, and I, <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Who, with wandering eye,<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Did declare</p>
<p>&ldquo;Im sorry you drowned, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
It&rsquo;s quite alright! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
See, I did this on purpose. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I grew lost in these immense halls, where reside few flies or other crawling/flying pests. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I&rsquo;ve become weak and weary. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Endeavored and convicted I had adhered well to His plan for me, I drowned myself in this holy water, so that I may too join in beatitude and sing of all creation and substance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, man, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
This isn&rsquo;t holy water. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We&rsquo;re in a non-denominational mega-church, dude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; dear&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Lord, I have done nothing than what you have intended for me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I spun webs——I too created. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And have taken in supply of sundry subsistence as to what you have deemed fit for my creature. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Anywhow, I should at least be happy to make it to the Rainbow Bridge——seeing as I have no soul and such&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, well, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
If you made it there, what would you even do? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Like, you won&rsquo;t be able to catch flies or, like, fuck and make baby spiders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; well, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I could surely spin webs and wander about without fear of predation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I would respire without worry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And I&rsquo;ll visit with my hundreds of children who number in the count of faithful arachnids. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I should even wait for you, and we&rsquo;ll converse and laugh without fear of one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how to respond to that&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Like, the Rainbow Bridge isn&rsquo;t real. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Some white lady made it up to neuroticize children into the old question of animals and if they have souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; my&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Where am I going, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I don&rsquo;t really know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;Lord&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; Um, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Did you vote?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
There is no worldy authority.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
There is no King of Israel. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Our High Priest is here, but he only appears to very special people and never to spiders. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So I reject all confusion of mass morality and material concerns. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Moreover, animals have very few rights in this country—–I am inelligable for citizenship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Um, do you know where we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morgan Street, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We&rsquo;re on Morgan Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw&hellip; Geez&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
No man, I&rsquo;m sorry; we&rsquo;re in Wilmington, North Carolina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I believe you&rsquo;re mistaken in this instance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We are surely in St. Louis, Missouri, on Morgan Street. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Can you not see? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We&rsquo;re in an old shack with a piano.&rdquo;</p>
