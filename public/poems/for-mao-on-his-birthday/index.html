    <h1>For Mao, On his Birthday</h1>

    

    <p>And there, in the dementiatic years
of the 19th century</p>
<p>The faintest natal nascence of</p>
<p>the second kingdom was born</p>
<p>in the middle of the middle.</p>
<p>Poor Hong Xiuquan smiled</p>
<p>in his tomb</p>
<p>(of which there was none.</p>
<p>More like ashes</p>
<p>Dispirate, stirring).</p>
<p>God is funny like that,</p>
<p>to send his direct message through failure</p>
<p>to beget another,</p>
<p>indeed more confused,</p>
<p>and yet,</p>
<p>in contradiction, closer to enacting the truth.</p>
<p>Who are the &ldquo;Jews&rdquo; anyway?</p>
<p>Just by reading the newspapers</p>
<p>I can tell you who is chosen.</p>
<p>Perhaps 1966 was closer to 0</p>
<p>than anything else.</p>
<p>And 2050 will be like 33.</p>
<p>Whencefrom already mists the yakubian acid rain.</p>
<p>And the white devils are so myopically focused</p>
<p>on trading one umbrella for another,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t even see the distant red star.</p>
<p>Admittedly faint, it shines brighter now</p>
<p>than did 100 years ago.</p>
<p>The way to know?</p>
<p>The learned astronomer can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>(won&rsquo;t?) see it.</p>
<p>Even if one were to frantically search</p>
<p>through the peer reviewed,</p>
<p>one wouldn&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<p>Neither would I, though I do know where to look.</p>
<p>Rather, I feel it</p>
<p>as Christ&rsquo;s radiant smile.</p>
<p>And so I leave the dome for</p>
<p>the lecture hall,</p>
<p>snickering.</p>
