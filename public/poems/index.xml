      <description>&amp;ldquo;I knew you would do this to me!&#xA;You kept me from the hills of Spain and locked up in a book to heap desires upon my soul in pain.&#xA;You had a joke at me, from beyond, at my shouts into the black which echoed back,&#xA;and it split your sides to see my eyes turned to the skies when all the manna farms laid fallow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have not laughed in my entire life—— and I know that, once, a dark cloud descended down, and out stretched a hand holding spatula and Burger King crown,</description>

      <description>He hung the yellow ribbon that he won, Same color as my piss when drank ice tea, Same color as that star that shines: the sun That shines on Hofstra University.&#xA;I sniff my fingers cuz they smell like dick, And he the same to have a joke at my Desire to sense it all until I&amp;rsquo;m sick; Hopes to own ribbon gold at proper time.&#xA;And fuck that pagan statesman who once wrote That he would be forgot because he ain&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Are heavy footfalls bleating fast This organized a pleated past Neat, arranged~~&#xA;Like those sniveling eyes To which history grew wise And blew its nose in the river.&#xA;Something like ballast in my gut, Like if ten thousand peanut nuts Were squeezed into a kiss.&#xA;It means I cannot leave this earth They said was mine on day of birth—— It means all y&amp;rsquo;all are alone.&#xA;I said all y&amp;rsquo;all can have the ocean; Best make humiliation motion When I come to laugh on Fridays.</description>

      <description>Gyorg sniggers from the depths, hidden in a forest of unyielding stalks—– rejecting all sight and light: but his eyes adjust.&#xA;From the hilltop, outside forsaken town, the trees are begged to clear so as to see the laughs of the rolling earth frozen in space, not time.&#xA;Faith could move a mountain, but it won&amp;rsquo;t.&#xA;And if the abyss around which identity comports was found filled—— even on a cloudy winter&amp;rsquo;s morn, when the gray streets are irrevocably empty, and the universally chosen stillness relinquishes the geography—— I know you would dig it up again.</description>

      <description>Lois found out she has brain cancer , so, she&amp;rsquo;s in the corner with her husband, away from the concourse of persons nearly obstructing the catechist&amp;rsquo;s proceedings.&#xA;Fr. Nick is away too, surely holding his eyes in his hands&#xA;in another room.&#xA;René is to be crucified , as if dissolving the parts detracted from the mysterious hole.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s the sixth jurisdiction to try him, but I asked a question——</description>

      <description>She lived, like Anna, in a chapel, Until Father, Behest of Pastor, Sent her away, Because Christmas was over.&#xA;She came home with us, And I was envious of her soft yet textured Red dress And green trimming.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t think she liked the window. Though she would always smile back at me, She once asked where all the reds and blues And yellows and greens had gone.&#xA;I liked to watch her, Plumage at altar, Swept in the careening dance of light, Standing up tall and full.</description>

      <description>Painter: He saw me there. Fuck! Fuck! He saw me In my stupid stupid trapper hat.&#xA;He laughed at me, Because I was on the bike In my work clothes, Debased, Layered and fat and soles falling Out everywhere—— It&amp;rsquo;s not my fault it&amp;rsquo;s fucking cold!&#xA;He, Off to some function or soirée Surely (He once laughed at my Belvedere!) Without a care.&#xA;You oughta Tell them To let me back into the school.</description>

      <description>The trifles of erstwhile class can still explode—— Like that night in 1900, there on Blythe Road, When the Golden Dawn became an amber dusk, And all their spells were revealed as dust. The air was brisk, still the wind, When the gayest man alive arrived to rescind The sickly londoners&amp;rsquo; mandate to throne: New became the moon, and all light was gone.&#xA;Yeats: Look all and laugh, For our feeble master&amp;rsquo;s envoy Is but a skinny little boy In a silly mask!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s recognizable—— The hole in my palm Is sizeable: A coconut un-songed Sleeps hidden in hay, And cock crows the way&#xA;Yet obscured by snow—— Thus, it can be recalled Before you even know That paint dries off the wall: Former figure now pasted away; The workers choke their working day.&#xA;Would that he could reveal The oustide&amp;rsquo;s in. Could that he would make real The inside&amp;rsquo;s win, Make prodigal those parts gone astray And bring back hither not but to say:</description>

      <description>D: &amp;ldquo;Heart sanctified by walk in Death&amp;rsquo;s dark halls. Souls morter&amp;rsquo;d and brick-ed reach towards the sky, Or cross the way by holler through the walls: &amp;lsquo;Remember me, what life has rent awry!&amp;rsquo;&#xA;Now closed my ears to onanism&amp;rsquo;s shouts, And beeping horns who wish to have their way, And tweakers who wish me to be without My head, so with my torso they could lay.&#xA;They chose to travel here!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Geez, Mary, can&amp;rsquo;t you tell a good idol from a poor idol? There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of fine wood and stone available; Those materials have much more grounded aesthetic precedent anyway! I&amp;rsquo;m so confused&amp;hellip; do they even make graven images out of flesh and blood?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Inscribed in body of the blest North Star: The promissory note, which still doth read In future that all debt be burned by fire And smashed to sand by force majeure of sea––</description>

      <description>They run amok all o’er the land. They leave us not but strife. I so pronounce end times at hand To live alone this brutish life With them who speak but naught. Cut out your tongue with bladed knife That, aye, not you may speak as ought! A triple crown with smiles Unlocks all that: what they had sought; But, aye, reject the earthen wiles Of him who does must play.</description>

      <description>When, with my plate at table I recline, To fill, therewith, that flesh-ed hungry gorge, Away from putrid slurry are mine eyes, And shut are ears to cheers from smiths at forge.&#xA;Oh! Curse our peepers, who, so wont to fly, Protest therein that what is needed most! Indignantly, our hearts prefer the sky To wretched meek: the feet, bound down below.&#xA;Look here! Be chastised one who ne&amp;rsquo;er desired To claim the bed lest &amp;lsquo;someone&amp;rsquo; made him tired!</description>

      <description>Well&amp;hellip;. I- I have a diagnosis, you know.&#xA;It means there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with me&amp;hellip; but they don&amp;rsquo;t know what.&#xA;I imagine it&amp;rsquo;s very hard for them, trying to figure that for a time or so, every now and then.&#xA;I have a body and other physical characteristics, but I suppose that isn&amp;rsquo;t what you mean.&#xA;I mean, that hasn&amp;rsquo;t really got anything to do with ME, does it?&#xA;Sure, I have feelings, even beliefs, but they only come in for dinner or supper, even tea, I&amp;rsquo;d say, Then they go merrily on their way.</description>

      <description>It was 10:15 AM, Sunday,&#xA;And you stood and trembled for an hour and a half.&#xA;I, with four hours of sleep, particularly susceptible to the energy of the moment,&#xA;Saw your glasses falling As you looked into the Book And immediately grew afraid.</description>

      <description>A man was born into this curse-d earth Within full sin, without the means to know How to begin his lifelong mortal search For the sole soul who chose to come below.&#xA;The brokenness within he did not want, Nor to be trapped inside a body seen By those all those, too, who, blind within the haunt Know not the spectres tied inside machines.&#xA;But He went down beseeching him to hear The music that is played beyond his realm: At length from God&amp;rsquo;s when matter comes more dear: his ship of death——he must give up the helm</description>

      <description>Pope Saint John Paul II, Vicar of Our Lord on Earth for 27 years, We look to your guidance and Rely on your intercession to help us Navigate this wretched physical thing,&#xA;May we, too, Benefit from malfeasance, corruption, and assassination.&#xA;May we, too, Lie and omit on behalf of associates And ourselves To save face and reputation, Thus influence.&#xA;May we, too, Use whatever financial and spiritual power To bring down governments, Fund mercenaries, And create political crises.</description>

      <description>Though lack——indeed——inserted there We still could find our way. The preparation strectching show Would not be won that day.&#xA;But my tripartite spirit likes All touching and caress, And if the motion felt so good, My astral left this mess.&#xA;Two bodies thus transcend their realm—— It sent me through the stars. The Texans tried but could not stop Two rocketships to Mars!&#xA;And please forgive my thinly veiled Perverted enchanté.</description>

      <description>AUDIO&#xA;Three of us in the tub On the side of the stage.&#xA;The pastor, my father, a drowned wolf spider, and I, Who, with wandering eye,&#xA;Did declare&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Im sorry you drowned, man.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh, no, It&amp;rsquo;s quite alright! See, I did this on purpose. I grew lost in these immense halls, where reside few flies or other crawling/flying pests. I&amp;rsquo;ve become weak and weary. Endeavored and convicted I had adhered well to His plan for me, I drowned myself in this holy water, so that I may too join in beatitude and sing of all creation and substance.</description>

      <description>Call did the Major Briggs For all the able bodied men. He called them to kneel——to dig. While cedars trembled in the wind&#xA;They sailed their way to Beacon Mound To render convex their earthen hole—— Built a hollow cone forth the ground And desired the Union to lull Over the rocky shoals and shallows. Savages aground, they&amp;rsquo;d show themselves, numbered sixty——&#xA;Would defend their island home hallowed And slaughter all the enemy.</description>

Rather, I should be a leaf in the (How long will the [Wind.] blow?)&#xA;Or should like to burrow or claw a way from out my skin And fly away to the moon Or even yonder and on, Up where the eye knows but cannot see, Where the assemblage of rocks and minerals, Which we call inhabitance, Would only will to oblige And collapse:</description>

He went away from me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In the aftermath of the embrace—— In the broadening of the seperation between the one going Coming Down And the One remaining in that place away from places—— The increasing distance between two hearts Is not negative, Empty,&#xA;But rather is filled with that expansion of love Which pours out from the cracks in amphorous memory-vessels.</description>

      <description>AUDIO&#xA;&amp;ldquo;May it please the court, and may I first present That Mrs. Babbitt came to The Bay with God&amp;rsquo;s assent. In Trump&amp;rsquo;s America, it was allowed That Mr. Babbitt be seen as well-endowed (Monitarily, of course), and though she was worthless Was proud to be named Queen of The Pool Service. And when the feds called the loan, she was too retarded To make any sense of it, she started With the Pizzagate and the cabal, And the homeless, immigrants——the wall That she climbed——in her pocket a knife, And for the brief moment &amp;lsquo;fore the end of her life She got to feel in charge of her fate; A creature so useless been forced to wait for any sense of agency, Judge, and Michael, y&amp;rsquo;all know me, How I was appointed by Him to know The faults and fallings of the masses below.</description>

      <description>The cries of them so deaf&amp;rsquo;ning none can hear. The pile of unknown souls grows year by year, The groans in our walls——our treats and coffee, Then our naive hope (theirs too was lofty)&#xA;Forgets the felt of those on whom we walk, Them of whom built the building where we talk Of &amp;ldquo;concrete things&amp;rdquo; when with haints we cuddle—— Death to those who died in pointless struggle.&#xA;Only some can say what all can smell: The burning flesh and screams of hell, There from there again it go: Down down down down below.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I was the first to have heard. I published the newspapers on that day. I was the one they deigned absurd, But when the sea parted, who else made way? No one else discovered the third In King David&amp;rsquo;s little psalms. None else flew——two-winged bird—— While they hid faces in palms. When each one in their cowardice deferred, Only I dared speak the truth, When, as with age, the wisdom was transferred, &amp;lsquo;Twas I who occupied the youth.</description>

And dont you find it queer That it lacks all purpose?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;But what do you mean?&amp;rdquo; Mr. Crow asked. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing on the surface—— Time passed here is worthless!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Your dreams aflush With urban lust——&amp;rdquo; (Bird then fixed his mask), &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll not find then What isn&amp;rsquo;t present near.</description>

      <description>True blessings are those who fall out the sky When, laughing, God asks &amp;ldquo;What did you expect?&amp;rdquo; And offers up no satisfacted Why Except that some are victims of neglect.&#xA;And spoiled child I was so I shall be. In bigger homes are words lost in the grout, In one room holes no tile is to be seen—— And Taurus Suns——they cannot go without.&#xA;But still, when eye meets eye or hand meets hand It all transcends that what it was before—— Our words contented within both demands, And so I like it when we share one door.</description>

      <description>I never want to take my medicine, Cuz then I&amp;rsquo;m too sick to write—— Too believed my feigned intelligence When with my body I pick a fight;&#xA;When spit, like truth, becomes hard to swallow, And fatigue replaces rage—— When, with my own nausea, I can cease to borrow Others&amp;rsquo; vomit on the page.&#xA;But I live in a place with hundreds of peepholes, And &amp;ldquo;Tanya! Tell me the news!&amp;rdquo; (And sorry to the Mexican who shared my needles, Cuz HIV is coming soon).</description>

      <description>Somehow, the mullet breached the sea wall To terrorize the neighborhood with their squelching—— Constantly sucking debris into their maws, And the endemic AC hum isn&amp;rsquo;t helping. Another night sat illicitly, As the school sought to swallow One half of symmetry. Reflected on the lake within the hollow&#xA;Was a brightly lit home partitioned by palm. Subtle piano notes sounded about the air, But those frenzied fish disquited the calm—— A thought was inserted: it wasn&amp;rsquo;t fair That nobody told Narcissus That what he saw was something other.</description>

You set the heavenly bodies in motion—— At times agreeing, At times disagreeing.&#xA;My God, you created every living and &amp;ldquo;non-living&amp;rdquo; thing with purpose; In our iniquity and ignorance before you we are worthless.</description>

Shame no one will ever know.&#xA;And they can wipe and sweep, scrub and scrub, But there are gaps and eaves that we have snuck within, where they will never ever find us.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s after the end of the world, don&amp;rsquo;t you know that yet?&#xA;Since 33, most have believed the Apocalypse would come in their lifetime. It&amp;rsquo;s probably because when something ends, it is then finished, And finished things will no longer produce novelty. Admittedly, most of this Planet&amp;rsquo;s novelty is bleak—— How often immense hope is co-opted by the forces of fear To end in failure. So too History must end, But it came before thyme and after singing; In this life it ain&amp;rsquo;t no Burger Kinging—— When Ol&amp;rsquo; John P had his way, the truth we did forget.</description>

For he does shine and does irradiate A crow and dog sharing some fentanyl With a man a hard earned meal served on plate Stars or shine morality rendered null As all that gives indifferently destroys.

A prophet is never recognized is his own home, at best, And so i like to see things I’ve never seen before. The south is so provincial in ways we often forget. Here, it’s a phone booth every couple blocks, most neighborhoods have a community garden, Sundry others which beget, Freedom, but somehow, with such amenities, hearts harden.</description>

And they were cached there of their own selfish wants When four little children began drowning at once. They went untried for their crimes &amp;ndash; no one saw them Because rays of light found four bodies at the bottom. And no matter the memories of the secrets stashed there sliced and sewn up, Because the body, Every time, Forgets out of pure frustration At its sensations Anesthetized, While the digits of demons deposit eggs that when grown up Too remember nothing of the host&amp;rsquo;s consummate constipation.</description>

But oh, if they don’t sound the much needed bell That the day of judgement has arrived.</description>

It makes little difference to the truth; Besides, nothing can be done.&#xA;But there are still those nights, Just before sleep, When you hope, Maybe even believe, That the miracle will be you.&#xA;You&amp;rsquo;ll wake with firm foot And run in ecstasy to the kitchen Or the living room Or porch, To holler: &amp;ldquo;Hallelujah!</description>

But when the dog steals all the food Or when a child, denied, does cry, &amp;lsquo;Twas by a Spinozistic mode Those barbaric desires fly Into the poor and ill-restrained mechanical animal mind.</description>

      <description>And there, in the dementiatic years of the 19th century&#xA;The faintest natal nascence of&#xA;the second kingdom was born&#xA;in the middle of the middle.&#xA;Poor Hong Xiuquan smiled&#xA;in his tomb&#xA;(of which there was none.&#xA;More like ashes&#xA;Dispirate, stirring).&#xA;God is funny like that,&#xA;to send his direct message through failure&#xA;to beget another,&#xA;indeed more confused,&#xA;and yet,&#xA;in contradiction, closer to enacting the truth.</description>

      <description>I was 6 years in the desert Self-exiled, by my own power. All gold once found then became dirt Heart-housed demons them they showered. There, whencefrom buried to my neck Came forth my savior with eyes kind Not as knight, me to pull from wreck, But sickle-celled black man, lame, blind. Snow from his nose poured on my head- &amp;ldquo;My poor child destroyed in his self, Foolish to think that you are dead Undying light offers his help.</description>

      <description>I miss that little boy There were days when he cried and screamed But there are days when I do that too And I think he liked me - They were all calling for me to come back I was looking at pictures today They exist like beacons in a haze But the fog is too thick- Nothing is illuminated When was this? Who am I? Your smile is so bright there and I&amp;rsquo;ll never see it again nor remember how it was conjured in the first place To you, I must be a corpse with a death mask- And some wretched animating force moving me- And you were fooled to think this dead alive But perhaps by this power it was- and so it will I dug it all up today- and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry it was a demon in me, or something But even he could grow weary, and I often tucked him in with a glass of warm milk so we could be left alone.</description>

      <description>N.1 If all was light, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to see. I will go where I am led and through this giving thanks, may I be brought into what I would always become, and may my heart quicken in gladness at the thought of doing it again. N.2 If it&amp;rsquo;s true that the two primary emotions are fear and love, and that they are mutually exclusive, Then maybe FDR did nothing wrong, and to be afraid is to let the evil of the world enter your heart.</description>

      <description>A swift flick, swerve Placed us here In this grey-washed atrium watching television on the floor- they gave us nowhere to sit. Even in that moment I felt a strange lilt in my heart.&#xA;Two bulls: dumb, headstrong, naive, smug, stubborn, and born with a recalcitrant need to be known made use of, and loved. Oceans in our eyes and rainforests in our hearts. Besides that, nothing in common. But still, you saw me smile and wheeled or wobbled over to attend to me.</description>

      <description>Like the creek happens to run with automobile traffic (Though they are at best enemies) so too, if you find yourself amongst the 7 foilaged trees in the heart of winter, likely without your rosary, The Beam comes around the bend And the tic turns your head To meet its gaze feeling as steam Screaming, you&amp;rsquo;ll kneel. eventually, prostrate, Ants will crawl up your nose And the orchestra will appear held there, supplicant They&amp;rsquo;ll play and you will cry, And as the intermission starts, while the conductor and the concert master shake hands, smiling towards a thunderous applause with no eyes, a car will fly off of Fordham Blvd.</description>

      <description>He was taken Lifted into the sky And was replaced with a copy The copy looked and sounded like him and kept up the ruse for awhile sweet + tender, delicate like a lily in the cold grew legs and ran to the top of the mountain, and threw itself off tumbled down holes in leaves Flowers left in disarray all behind for the hooves of bulls to later trample as they tried in vain to pick them up with their teeth, Lucky ones digested once he grabbed her by the hair, led her outside to shrieks + hollers a crowd formed Booing and gnashing teeth she was gnashed in turn and so the choir found themselves too gnashed at once all together in inexplicable violence that night they took the copy back and the original was returned with memories formed by the bubbling of Alka-Seltzer in stomach acid And as it bubbled, his hands grew to the size of stones, whence he had to drag forever </description>

      <description>If beauty has one immutible, intersubjective quality, is is transience. Like a lightning bolt from above, it flashes for but an instance in the grand scheme of things, and then it is gone&amp;hellip; On Friday, I passed it in its sublimity. Halted in my tracks as if it were a wall. On Monday, in its place was death, decay, disgust, dread. I covered my mouth and ran just to trip and fall, to lie there, in that salinity, prostrate, for some time.</description>

      <description>I wish it were easier to become dead I&amp;rsquo;m only halfway there I feel in time and space but not completely As if at risk for flying away were I not held by a string But the wind still blows this way and that Mother Mary please prays for me Or fixes me with a stake to one thing forever </description>

      <description>Old and weathered, Muddy ground giving way, Truths held as fact once proven otherwise, Horde of gold into dirt, Dirt into gold Spat upon, Cast out, Shat upon, Beaten, Abused, Objectified, Internalized, No water, no sun, New moon, no light, Rock, wind, debris; Where else but the navel with your sight?</description>

      <description>Slow it up speed it up! Like the derivative of a circle, Like a sin wave,&#xA;Like the sublime and gorgeous Hills of the North Carolina piedmont.&#xA;I want to feel that incline. I want to roll my body down, But this is not enough.&#xA;I can&amp;rsquo;t go back up once I&amp;rsquo;m in the valley; Physics don&amp;rsquo;t work that way. And I&amp;rsquo;m left on my back With eyes towards the sky.</description>

      <description>Awoken from slumber and feeling the tension of the moment par coup, I flew to the archives, meticulously kept but thus far unread. These records changed me; One realizes one can&amp;rsquo;t let go of things one has said.&#xA;Forsooth, the voices of the pages have been whispering to my unconscious, And at last question meets answer.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d been using a crutch to stand; One outgrows such things.&#xA;And yet the memories circle me as vultures; I can&amp;rsquo;t run from the easeness of tender voices, heartbeats, gazes.</description>

      <description>1882: Nietzsche tears through the heavenly veil to find the Body of God, dead for 300 years. The corpse was rotting; maggot demons crawled through all His divine orifices, and the blood from the wound made centuries ago continued to gush forth, invisible to the naked eye, pouring like a monsoon on the realm of the demiurge, drowning all of humanity in ordained monadity.&#xA;C. 50: The remaining druids secretly gather in the Scottish Hills to perform a final ritual.</description>

      <description>Then was reckoning,&#xA;In the still and hollow night We saw stray cats and hooting owls, And from the chords of your guitar A seismic force shook the world.&#xA;Buildings burned; people screamed; regimes collapsed. The smell of blood + fire took my nostrils.&#xA;I fell on my broken knees. A brick split upon my head. Ash clouded my eyes. The unanimous groans of a condemned world Could not drown your voice.</description>

      <description>When the Nation&amp;rsquo;s day is finally done, And the Rockefellers have no more fun, And the fever finds its source, And the project runs its course: None will weep at America&amp;rsquo;s last breath, When the yoeman-bourgeois reaches its death. If mine&amp;rsquo;s been beaten, enslaved, riddled with strife, Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t yours end early? You&amp;rsquo;ve had an air conditioner your whole life.</description>
