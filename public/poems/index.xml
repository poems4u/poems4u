      <description>“Amen, I say to you, my Father in heaven created man to be of two natures. He has a Logical Mind and an Emotional Mind. Only when these two balances are brought on the same plane can man live as he was made to. My Father ordained this synthesizing of halves before time, before creation. It was declared thus, The Wise Mind.”&#xA;“Why won’t you tell me to kill myself, O Lord?</description>

      <description>As I lay me down to sleep None could keep mine eyes from weep Except one small, distant hope Which saves me from that self-inflicted rope Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away So with a start I prattle about my miserable and wretched hovel Strewn here and there, chairs and tables overturned, hurrying to find that shovel With which I march to Juno for to dredge him abreast The man with whom I&amp;rsquo;ll walk before the throne, damned the rest Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away On that climb I&amp;rsquo;ll gaze with him upon the throng-ed score And our weeping for them will be the sweeping river which them keeps from the ajar-ed door Our boundless pity will be that which plunges the vast multitude down below On my knees for it the Lord I&amp;rsquo;ll beg for mercy, that what I did not know Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away But wait!</description>

      <title>Of Pondering While You&#39;re Making a Sandwhich or Whatever</title>

      <description>Whereof your thoughts when discovering you ran, In begging to end in circles again? Whenceforth you came indeed there you shall go; Wherefrom the soul us made we cannot know. And what would become of the Holy Saw? That is, what was once seen, now not at all, or the Holy Aurai Voir.</description>

      <description>When, when he snubbed his nose at me Oh, how I bristled with delight Nothing but evil could he be who took such pleasure in my plight It was already known, the thought which bore its way into his mind Serreptitious there, demon bought solely for pleasure of its kind But when the dog steals all the food Or when a child, denied, does cry &amp;lsquo;Twas by a Spinozistic mode Those barbaric desires fly into the poor and ill-restrained mechanical animal mind How could impulsed thoughts be detained in faculties considered blind?</description>

      <description>And there, in the dementiatic years of the 19th century&#xA;The faintest natal nascence of&#xA;the second kingdom was born&#xA;in the middle of the middle.&#xA;Poor Hong Xiuquan smiled&#xA;in his tomb&#xA;(of which there was none.&#xA;More like ashes&#xA;Dispirate, stirring).&#xA;God is funny like that,&#xA;to send his direct message through failure&#xA;to beget another,&#xA;indeed more confused,&#xA;and yet,&#xA;in contradiction, closer to enacting the truth.</description>

      <description>I was 6 years in the desert Self-exiled, by my own power All gold once found then became dirt Heart-housed demons them they showered There, whencefrom buried to my neck Came forth my savior with eyes kind Not as knight, me to pull from wreck, But sickle-celled black man, lame, blind. Snow from his nose poured on my head- &amp;ldquo;My poor child destroyed in his self, Foolish to think that you are dead Undying light offers his help.</description>

      <description>I miss that little boy There were days when he cried and screamed But there are days when I do that too And I think he liked me - They were all calling for me to come back I was looking at pictures today They exist like beacons in a haze But the fog is too thick- Nothing is illuminated When was this? Who am I? Your smile is so bright there and I&amp;rsquo;ll never see it again nor remember how it was conjured in the first place To you, I must be a corpse with a death mask- And some wretched animating force moving me- And you were fooled to think this dead alive But perhaps by this power it was- and so it will I dug it all up today- and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry it was a demon in me, or something But even he could grow weary, and I often tucked him in with a glass of warm milk so we could be left alone.</description>

      <description>N.1 If all was light, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to see. I will go where I am led and through this giving thanks, may I be brought into what I would always become, and may my heart quicken in gladness at the thought of doing it again. N.2 If it&amp;rsquo;s true that the two primary emotions are fear and love, and that they are mutually exclusive, Then maybe FDR did nothing wrong, and to be afraid is to let the evil of the world enter your heart.</description>

      <title>For James, and the PSR</title>

      <description>A swift flick, swerve Placed us here In this grey-washed atrium watching television on the floor- they gave us nowhere to sit. Even in that moment I felt a strange lilt in my heart.&#xA;Two bulls: dumb, headstrong, naive, smug, stubborn, and born with a recalcitrant need to be known made use of, and loved. Oceans in our eyes and rainforests in our hearts. Besides that, nothing in common. But still, you saw me smile and wheeled or wobbled over to attend to me.</description>

      <description>Like the creek happens to run with automobile traffic (Though they are at best enemies) so too, if you find yourself amongst the 7 foilaged trees in the heart of winter, likely without your rosary, The Beam comes around the bend And the tic turns your head To meet its gaze feeling as steam Screaming, you&amp;rsquo;ll kneel. eventually, prostrate, Ants will crawl up your nose And the orchestra will appear held there, supplicant They&amp;rsquo;ll play and you will cry, And as the intermission starts, while the conductor and the concert master shake hands, smiling towards a thunderous applause with no eyes, a car will fly off of Fordham Blvd.</description>

      <description>He was taken Lifted into the sky And was replaced with a copy The copy looked and sounded like him and kept up the ruse for awhile sweet + tender, delicate like a lily in the cold grew legs and ran to the top of the mountain, and threw itself off tumbled down holes in leaves Flowers left in disarray all behind for the hooves of bulls to later trample as they try in vain to pick them up with their teeth, Lucky ones digested once he grabbed her by the hair, led her outside to shrieks + hollers a crowd formed Booing and gnashing teeth she was gnashed in turn and so the choir found themselves too gnashed at once all together in inexplicable violence that night they took the copy back and the original was returned with memories formed by the bubbling of Alka-Seltzer in stomach acid And as it bubbled, his hands grew to the size of stones, whence he had to drag forever </description>

      <description>I wish it were easier to become dead I&amp;rsquo;m only halfway there I feel in time and space but not completely As if at risk for flying away were I not held by a string But the wind still blows this way and that Mother Mary please prays for me Or fixes me with a stake to one thing forever </description>
