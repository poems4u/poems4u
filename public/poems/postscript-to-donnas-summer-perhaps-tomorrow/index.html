    <p>As I lay me down to sleep <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
None could keep mine eyes from weep <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Except one small, distant hope <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Which saves me from that self-inflicted rope <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So with a start I prattle about my miserable and wretched hovel <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Strewn here and there, chairs and tables overturned, hurrying to find that shovel <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
With which I march to Juno for to dredge him abreast <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The man with whom I&rsquo;ll walk before the throne, damned the rest <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>On that climb I&rsquo;ll gaze with him upon the throng-ed score <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And our weeping for them will be the sweeping river which them keeps from the ajar-ed door <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Our boundless pity will be that which plunges the vast multitude down below <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
On my knees for it the Lord I&rsquo;ll beg for mercy, that what I did not know <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But wait! The throne is vacate <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And the seemingly evicted masses now there, impossible to placate <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
There, at the empty chair of God, an ongoing competition of jumping and screaming <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We search around in vain for our Lord, hearts bereaving <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Suddenly, a trap door swings open at my feet, my poor companion left behind <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&ldquo;The pulp so bitter; How shall taste the rind?&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Down I&rsquo;m cast, into a room far below, where stands only she <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Her gaze betrays for whom she sought was not me <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow will be the day <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But my beloved Holy Mother still greets me with a warm-hearted sigh <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Her other Son (the important One) sleeps elsewhere, we knowest not where He lie <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
She who wanted a different man and me a different woman&hellip; Alas, look! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As she reaches for the record of my life, that despicable book <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
A tear then rolls from her eye, and she begins to speak: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&ldquo;I long with peirced heart to forgive you, but, oh, I am so weak <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Only my Son can do that, and written here your pride betrays you.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That last unpurgable desire still plagues my soul: ten thousand years I&rsquo;ll go through <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The heat begins surrounded, her crossing me the last vision to greet my eye <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Before I forthwith started awake in my bed with a cry: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God! Thank God tomorrow shan&rsquo;t be the day <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When all my fear, and weeping, and sins are taken away!&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
