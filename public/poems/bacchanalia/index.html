    <p>Did arrive the fawns with horn resound <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
After fared was paid <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Docetic shapes emerged forth the ground <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Cornerstones got laid <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>&lsquo;Cuz Dr. Bacchus and his wife <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
(Astrologically Virgin) <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Had exited this foreign life <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And faced themselves as surgeons <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Scalpels circulated bout the air <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And pain bisected without care <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
To find there was nothing in the middle <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>&ldquo;And though the spiders itched us as riddles, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Still was planned the wedding feast <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Which had taken place upon Swiss Alps. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
From our hearts had come the yeast <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Which bubbled our absent doubts, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And we knew——we saw who would be there! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
A list of names too long to write: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
As many heads as they&rsquo;re our hairs—— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
My husband and Vierge&rsquo;s bride. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Our Lord was peaked just &lsquo;yond the wall <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And smiled the pictures we were draw,&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But back was turned when death came &lsquo;pon them <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
They learned the feet are at the bottom <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>They learned to damp for decompose and sag <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
That which was transcended then coming back <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Abstraction must revert immediacy <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So future tears were shed immediately <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Painful transition was all <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Was fine <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But lucidity was spun <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Was spent to dust <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Burgeoning and becoming <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Can grow <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Wearisome and heavy <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The Leaves Must Be Shed</p>
