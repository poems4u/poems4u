    <p>I miss that little boy <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
There were days when he cried and screamed <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But there are days when I do that too <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And I think he liked me - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
They were all calling for me to come back <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I was looking at pictures today <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
They exist like beacons in a haze <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But the fog is too thick- <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Nothing is illuminated <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When was this? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Who am I? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Your smile is so bright there <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and I&rsquo;ll never see it again <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
nor remember how it was conjured <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
in the first place <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To you, I must be a corpse <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
with a death mask- <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And some wretched animating force <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
moving me- <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And you were fooled to think this dead alive <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But perhaps by this power it <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
was- and so it will <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I dug it all up today- <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and I&rsquo;m sorry <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
it was a demon in me, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
or something <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But even he could grow weary, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and I often tucked him in with a glass of warm milk <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
so we could be left alone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>page 1 was proof <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and so are the photos <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But who took them? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Primitive notion of a <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
demon/mind union <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Calvin- where is he now? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>cop say she crazy now <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Please don&rsquo;t let it be her <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The spell was strong indeed, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
my prayers today were the haziest yet. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t focus <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And I wasn&rsquo;t there <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And I wasn&rsquo;t him <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And I didn&rsquo;t hear <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And it&rsquo;s all fading <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And the sat will stand <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And you&rsquo;ll take your place <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And I&rsquo;ll squint my eyes <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And I&rsquo;ll turn my turn- my neck <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And all I will forget <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Because I won&rsquo;t be able to find <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Who it was that paid my rent <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
(What was your name, again?) <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And I still remember Kiev.</p>
