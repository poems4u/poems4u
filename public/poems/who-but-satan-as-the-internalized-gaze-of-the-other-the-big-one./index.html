    <h1>Who but Satan as The Internalized Gaze of The Other? (The Big One)</h1>

    

    <p>When, when he snubbed his nose at me <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Oh, how I bristled with delight <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Nothing but evil could he be <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
who took such pleasure in my plight <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It was already known, the thought <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
which bore its way into his mind <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Serreptitious there, demon bought <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
solely for pleasure of its kind <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But when the dog steals all the food <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Or when a child, denied, does cry <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lsquo;Twas by a Spinozistic mode <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Those barbaric desires fly <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>into the poor and ill-restrained <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
mechanical animal mind <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
How could impulsed thoughts be detained <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
in faculties considered blind? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>With me it&rsquo;s much in the same way <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
My simple heart, incapable <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
of begrudging malice in day <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
in moonlight turns implacable <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And as such light shines through the grove <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And the pinewood smells of winter <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The trees dropped leaves- It wasn&rsquo;t chose <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
more than such frost in December <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But mine enemy loves his sole free will <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
One God amongst all men, henceforth to kill. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
