    <p>He was taken <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Lifted into the sky <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And was replaced with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
a copy <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The copy looked and sounded like him <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and kept up the ruse for awhile <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
sweet + tender, delicate like a <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
lily in the cold <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
grew legs and ran to the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
top of the mountain, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and threw itself off <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>tumbled down <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
holes in leaves <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Flowers left in disarray all behind <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
for the hooves of bulls to later <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
trample as they try in vain <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
to pick them up with their teeth, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Lucky ones digested <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>once he grabbed her by the hair, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
led her outside to shrieks + hollers <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
a crowd formed <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Booing and gnashing teeth <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
she was gnashed in turn <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and so the choir found themselves <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
too <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
gnashed at once all together <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>in inexplicable violence <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
that night they took the copy back <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
and the original was returned <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
with memories formed <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
by the bubbling of Alka-Seltzer <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
in stomach acid <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And as it bubbled, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
his hands grew to the size of stones, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
whence he had to drag <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
forever <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
